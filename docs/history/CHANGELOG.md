### Validation & Review

- Add lockbox review and truth acquisition assets (#87)
- Externalize lockbox validation artifacts (#94)
- Add backfill diagnostics review foundation (#81)
- Refactor diagnostics architecture and record 8RAW preset parity (#84)
- Framework foundation for productization diagnostics (#85)

### Performance

- Optimize DNA-dR product-ready preset (#91)
- Optimize dna_dr matrix-only preset runtime (#83)

### Cleanup Convergence

- Converge cleanup retirement on typed evidence and PeakHypothesis matrix (#79)
- Promote AsLS baseline and define linear-edge retirement gate (#78)

### Infrastructure

- Add PR stack repair workflow and reduce hook noise (#97)
- Add PR stack artifact boundary guardrails (#93)
- Docs cleanup: route public docs and private notes (#98, #99)

## 2026-05 late — Productization & Evidence Architecture

Handoff productization shipped a typed ProductWriter spine. Shared peak
identity evidence and sidecar-to-product activation contracts defined
how diagnostic evidence earns matrix write authority.

### Productization

- Handoff productization: scaffold → runtime → consumer migration → closeout (#64, #67, #68, #69)
- Product priority reset: Phase 1 delivery and Phase 1b gate (#72)
- Add typed PeakHypothesis activation contract and mode-window gate (#77)

### Evidence Chain

- Rebuild shared peak identity diagnostic evidence chain (#76)
- Pilot diagnostic Tier 2 evidence for provisional backfill (#75)
- Align matrix handoff with selected integration (#70)

### Pipeline Modernization

- Phase 1 peak pipeline modernization (#62)
- Close ASLS phase 1 scope (#63)
- Identity coherence V0.4 diagnostic acceptance (#60)

### Agent & Workflow

- Stabilize agent workflow and validation preflight (#65)
- Codify XIC agent workflow routing (#66)

## 2026-05 mid — Architecture Decomposition & Diagnostics

Major codebase decomposition: extraction, signal processing, alignment,
diagnostics, and configuration each got responsibility-scoped modules.
Targeted NL dropout convergence and region-first safe merge landed.

### Module Decomposition

- Define alignment module responsibility contract (#47)
- Split diagnostics report responsibilities (#48)
- Split alignment pipeline helper responsibilities (#49)
- Refactor diagnostics structure and characterize claim registry (#56)
- Refactor codebase cleanup inventory surfaces (#61)

### Targeted Extraction

- Targeted NL dropout evidence convergence (#52, #53)
- Region-first safe merge and audit bridge (#53)
- Add region-first validation and integration audit diagnostics (#54)
- Add targeted evidence consistency diagnostics (#51)

### Untargeted Alignment

- Untargeted alignment performance and matrix identity updates (#45)
- Tighten untargeted alignment gates and diagnostics (#46)

### Diagnostics & QC

- Add area mismatch and seed-aware backfill review diagnostics (#55)
- Optimize claim registry hot path (#57)
- Add instrument QC HCD audit (#58)

### Documentation

- Document project layout and scratch hygiene (#50)

## 2026-05 early — Untargeted Discovery & Evidence Scoring

Untargeted discovery pipeline v1 landed with CID neutral-loss seed
evidence, MS1 feature finding, and cross-sample alignment. Weighted
evidence scoring replaced the initial tier-based confidence system.

### Untargeted Discovery
