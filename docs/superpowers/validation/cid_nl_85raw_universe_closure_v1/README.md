# CID-NL 85RAW Universe Closure v1

Status: `pass`.

This is a no-RAW closure gate over the current 85RAW-derived CID-NL successor-authority universe. It answers whether the already active 95-cell default activation is the only default-output bucket in the current 85RAW artifact set.

## Closure

- Successor decisions: `511` cells.
- Write-authorized candidate universe: `147` cells.
- Default-active accepted cells: `95`.
- Explicitly non-active authorized candidates: `52` (held + blocked).
- Detected-baseline context preserved: `337`.
- Omitted no-target context preserved: `27`.

The checker compares sample-level accepted keys, transition-level held/blocked counts, successor-authority decisions, successor authority manifest keys, default matrix delta count, and 85RAW fix3 input hashes.

## Boundary

This gate does not rerun RAW and does not create new matrix authority. It only proves the current 85RAW-derived artifacts are internally closed for the CID-NL Discovery product question.
