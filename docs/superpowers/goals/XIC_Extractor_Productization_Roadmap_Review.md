# XIC Extractor Productization Roadmap Review

Doc placement: repo_support_doc
Doc kind: goal
Doc lifecycle: active
Repo owner: docs/product/backfill.md; docs/product/quant-matrix.md; docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-productization-control-plane.md
Doc exit rule: Retire or move to Obsidian after the Backfill/quant-matrix product docs and productization control plane fully absorb this roadmap direction.

Updated: 2026-06-19
Status: direction-reset roadmap

## Verdict

The scorer-centered lockbox follow-up is not the product direction.

The product direction is:

```text
Backfill = accepted quantification value for a missing cell
Backfill != detection
Backfill != truth claim
default quant matrix = detected + accepted Backfill
write authority = ProductionAcceptanceManifest only
```

Use the Backfill/quant-matrix product docs plus the productization control plane
as the authoritative roadmap. The retired Backfill quant-matrix blueprint and
the 2026-06-18 evidence-lifecycle blueprint are superseded and retained only as
Obsidian/source-history inputs.

## Read First

Use this roadmap with:

- [Backfill product doc](../../product/backfill.md)
- [Quant matrix product doc](../../product/quant-matrix.md)
- [productization control plane](../plans/2026-06-15-productization-control-plane.md)
- [productization status anchor](../productization/status/cc-framework-improvements-productization.md)
- [deepresearch index](../../deepresearch/README.md)

The control plane remains the authority for current tier, active lane, and
current writer surface. This roadmap records direction and phase order.
Deepresearch notes are background inputs and cannot grant write authority.

## Current Baseline

- Current Backfill product authority remains exactly 511 cells.
- Broad Backfill auto-write remains parked.
- `4613` remains the candidate/audit universe, not a writable pool.
- `3015` trace-matched unresolved rows remain review/adjudication targets, not
  writer rows.
- `1087` missing-overlay rows remain evidence gaps, not negative truth.
- Lockbox/owner-clean evidence remains non-authoritative challenge evidence.
- Manual wrong-peak/no-peak controls remain negative controls.
- Phase 0/1 do not change ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area,
  counted detection, GUI, default extraction, or broad Backfill authority.

Important nuance: parked broad Backfill means broad uncontracted writer
behavior is parked. Contracted accepted Backfill is the product direction.

## Dismantled Direction

Remove these as roadmap goals:

- scorer output schema as durable product authority;
- scorer metrics or stop-rule JSON as the next productization asset;
- lockbox scorer run over the included cases;
- scorer review report;
- scorer decision packet;
- any path where `accept/flag/reject` hides the evidence chain or grants write
  authority.

The lockbox package remains useful as shadow/review substrate. It must not
become a scoring-centered product lane.

## Product Spine

```text
source trace / integration artifact
-> PeakHypothesis
-> CellBackfillDecision
-> ProductionAcceptanceManifest
-> QuantMatrixVersion
-> Gallery/Report + CellProvenance sidecar
```

The product key for Backfill acceptance is `peak_hypothesis_id + sample_stem`.
`feature_family_id` is context/provenance only.

## Roadmap

Detailed entry gates, outputs, verification commands, done conditions, stop
rules, handoff requirements, and goal seeds live in the blueprint. This roadmap
only names phase order and product intent.

### Phase 0 - Blueprint And Cleanup Map

Objective:

Make the new Backfill/quant-matrix blueprint the active source of truth and
classify conflicting docs/code/tests as `delete`, `downgrade`, `adapt`, or
`keep`.

Done when:

- active routing docs point to the 2026-06-19 blueprint;
- Phase 0 handoff points to Phase 1 Shadow Adapter v1, and the active
  productization or branch-scoped handoff advances to Phase 2 after Phase 1
  closes;
- old 2026-06-18 blueprint is superseded;
- cleanup map exists;
- no control-plane update is needed unless tier/lane/authority actually changed.

### Phase 1 - Shadow Scoring Contract Adapter v1

Objective:

Contain shadow/scoring artifacts so they cannot become truth, reviewer slot
completion, or write authority.

Must preserve:

- one 72-case source: `lockbox_shadow_automation_cases_v1.tsv`;
- `shadow_only=true`;
- `write_authority=false`;
- no scorer run;
- no RAW/85RAW;
- no ProductWriter/matrix/workbook/default extraction changes.

Readiness label: `shadow_ready` only.

### Phase 2 - ProductionAcceptanceManifest v1

Objective:

Define and check the only Backfill artifact that can grant
`write_authority=true`. This phase does not write the default matrix yet.

### Phase 3 - QuantMatrixVersion Activation

Objective:

Use the production acceptance manifest to generate the default numeric
`quant_matrix` with detected plus accepted Backfill values, plus
`cell_provenance` and `row_summary`.

### Phase 4 - Gallery/Report Alignment

Objective:

Align the existing gallery/report with the manifest and sidecars. Do not rebuild
the gallery unless the contract requires it.

### Phase 5 - Validation And Promotion

Objective:

Separate contract correctness from scientific confidence. Synthetic/focused
tests prove schema and authority invariants. Real cohort/oracle evidence is
needed before production-ready claims.

## Stop Rules

Stop if a proposed goal:

- reintroduces composite scoring or score weights as write authority;
- treats Backfill as detection or truth claim;
- grants write authority from shadow/report/gallery/review artifacts;
- treats owner-clean, reviewer slot 2, or single-owner evidence as truth
  completion;
- creates a second independent lockbox case manifest;
- writes matrix output before a production acceptance manifest and expected-diff
  contract exist;
- hides detected/backfilled/manual/missing/rejected provenance;
- runs RAW/85RAW without the active phase naming that validation tier.

## Control Plane

No control-plane tier update is needed for Phase 0 because current maturity,
active lane, writer authority, selected values, counting behavior, ProductWriter
authority, and broad uncontracted Backfill state do not change.
