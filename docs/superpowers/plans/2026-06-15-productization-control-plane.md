# XIC Extractor productization control plane

日期: 2026-06-15
狀態: living plan / maintenance checklist
目前 readiness: `diagnostic_only` for this control document
主要依據: [current capability inventory](../reports/2026-06-15-current-capability-inventory-and-promotion-roadmap.md)
白話交接: [current productization handoff](../handoffs/current/cc-framework-improvements-productization.md)
可重用背景研究: [deepresearch notes](../../deepresearch/README.md)

## Authority

這份 control plane 擁有產品化 tier、active lane、WIP limit、promotion
packet 的權威。白話 handoff 只負責讓下一個 agent/session 快速接手，不可
用「比較新」覆蓋本文件的 tier 判斷。若文件衝突，先停止並同步:

1. `git status` / `git diff` 決定目前工作樹實況。
2. 本文件決定 maturity tier、active lane、WIP owner、promotion gate。
3. named specs/plans 決定 schema、CLI/config/output 行為契約。
4. validation notes 決定 RAW/benchmark evidence。
5. handoff 只做白話摘要、接手順序、下一步建議。

Global skills such as `handoff` / `worktree-report` can remind agents how to
write this handoff, but they are local environment helpers. XIC's enforceable
handoff contract is the version-controlled combination of this document,
`docs/agent/codex-operating-system.md`, `.codex/hooks/*`, and hook fixtures.

## Purpose

這份文件是日常產品化控制板。它解決三個反覆發生的問題:

1. 把 `diagnostic_only`、`shadow_ready`、`production_candidate` 誤以為已經正式推到產品。
2. 每次產品化只推進一小片，沒有形成使用者可重跑、可審閱、可稽核的完整 workflow。
3. 同時開太多 spec/diagnostic，最後都卡在「有產物，但不敢當正式產品」。

本文件不是 behavior spec，也不是 implementation plan。它是每次開工、收尾、review、規劃下一步時要更新的控制台。

## Hook enforcement

這份控制台不是只靠人記得。Repo-local hooks 會在三個位置提醒:

- `UserPromptSubmit`: prompt 提到產品化、promotion、正式功能、maturity tier、`method_manifest`、`review_roundtrip` 等詞時，自動把本文件拉回上下文。
- `PreToolUse`: write-like 工具準備修改 product/public surface 時，提醒必須更新本文件，或明確說明沒有 maturity tier 變動。
- `PostToolUse`: patch/write 類工具執行後，若工作樹已有 product/public surface diff 但本文件沒有變更，提醒 closeout 前補 board/log 或明確記錄 no-tier-change；若 product/control-plane 狀態可能變了但白話 handoff 沒有同步，也提醒 closeout 前補 handoff 或明確記錄 handoff 仍有效。

Hooks 是 guardrails，不是語意裁判。它們負責把你和 agent 拉回控制台；
真正的 tier 判斷仍要寫在 promotion packet、spec closeout 或 maintenance
log 裡。Project-local hooks 也需要 Codex runtime trust；如果 hooks 沒有被
trust 或沒有載入，本文件和 handoff checklist 仍是人工 closeout gate。

## Current medium-term active lanes

這次 goal 已擴大到中期可收斂項目，但仍維持 WIP limit。已完成的
`method_manifest_v1`、`targeted_schema_versioning_v1`、ReviewAction audited
apply copy、以及 sample metadata injection-order parity 不再佔 active lane。
Backfill standard-path activation 目前分成多個 release tier：72-row
high-signal-clean scoped writer、42-row low-scan-clean scoped writer、57-row
low-height-clean scoped writer、69-row low-height-low-scan-clean scoped
writer、以及 220-row low-height reintegration-stable scoped writer 都已用
explicit opt-in scope audit
filter 寫出 product matrix-only output，且各自的
`narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json` 通過並標
`readiness_tier=production_ready`。Low-height promotion 的前提不是降低
absolute height hard gate；舊的 full-trace heldout oracle 只有 19/20 pass，
`FAM008651/TumorBC2312_DNA` boundary error `1.16445 min` 超過 accepted
`0.1 min` ceiling。後續 diagnostic `expected_window_bounded` observed
reintegration mode 在既有 85RAW trace no-RAW replay 顯示 `padding=0.5 min`
可讓 selected 20/20 通過，最大 boundary error `0.0857986 min`、最大 area
relative error `0.0564106`；再接 explicit
`--low-height-clean-activation-scope-audit-tsv` writer，57/57 expected-diff
通過，duplicate/missing/unexpected/non-eligible/non-written/unchanged/blank
皆為 0。因此 low-height 只可宣稱 explicit 57-row scoped writer ready，不可
外推到 broad 4613-row 或 default behavior。
Low-height-low-scan promotion 是低高度與低 scan 的交集，不是 broadening by
height alone：`standard_low_height_low_scan_clean_trace` 要求
height <2e6、scan 7-9，且 shape/local-global/width/apex 都維持 clean。
既有 85RAW trace no-RAW bounded oracle 有 210 eligible rows / 51 families，
selected 20/20 pass，最大 boundary error `4.80376e-05 min`、最大 area
relative error `0.00881912`；再接
`--low-height-low-scan-clean-activation-scope-audit-tsv` writer，69/69
expected-diff 通過且 duplicate/missing/unexpected/non-eligible/non-written/
unchanged/blank 皆為 0。因此只能宣稱 explicit 69-row scoped writer ready。
擦邊的 apex-delta clean 也只到 `production_candidate`：heldout trace oracle
有 78 candidates / 27 families，selected 20 cases 只有 17/20 pass，最大
boundary error `2.19621 min`，所以也不得新增 apex-delta writer。
Width-only clean 也只到 `production_candidate`：heldout trace oracle 有
4 candidates / 3 families，selected 3 cases 只有 1/3 pass，最大 boundary
error `1.86561 min`、最大 area relative error `0.599229`，所以也不得新增
width-only writer。
Shape-margin clean 也只到 `production_candidate`：這個 probe 把 shape
similarity 降成 `0.93 <= shape < 0.95`，其他條件仍要乾淨；85RAW no-RAW
heldout trace oracle 有 18 candidates / 8 families，selected 8 cases 只有
6/8 pass，summary 最大 area relative error `0.198393`，所以也不得新增
shape-margin writer。
Broad 4613-row auto-write is now `parked` by
`backfill_broad_autowrite_feasibility_gate_v1`: 4613 is the candidate/audit
universe, not a writer pool. The durable next product asset is authority,
mechanical adjudication, structured review, truth acquisition, or trace-evidence
recovery. Do not open another broad Backfill scoped writer or diagnostic unless
a new independent truth source is named and a later goal explicitly adds
masked/product-writer oracle plus expected-diff.
新的 boundary-stability / reintegration-agreement diagnostic 已補上第一個
broader evidence class：`standard_peak_reintegration_stability_audit.py` 對同一
stored trace 做 full-trace 與 expected-window-bounded 兩種再積分，兩者都必須
在 `0.1 min / 10% area` 內吻合才算 eligible。既有 85RAW no-RAW consolidated
scope 實跑得到 299 eligible written rows、3227 ineligible、1087 missing
evidence，其中 271 eligible rows 不在四個既有 ready scoped writer envelope
內。This remains historical candidate evidence only. It does not reopen broad
Backfill auto-write after the 2026-06-18 park decision and must not be used as a
new writer predicate.
後續 low-height reintegration-stable promotion 把這個 candidate pool 的一個
可驗證子集合推到 ready：直接把 299 個 stability eligible rows 全部寫入仍被
formal all-stability family oracle 擋住。該 oracle
`standard_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace` 記錄 299 個
audit-intersection rows / 77 families，從同 family 的 1694 個 detected trace
candidates 選 20 個代表案例，結果 19/20；失敗的
`FAM000949/NormalBC2261_DNA` area relative error 是 `0.19621`，超過 accepted
10% ceiling。可放行的是 stability eligible、
activation row 仍 written、且 `cell_height <2e6` 的 220 rows / 66 families。
Formal no-RAW 85RAW heldout family oracle
`standard_low_height_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace` is explicitly
family-level, not a row-identity oracle: the summary records
`candidate_family_scope_match_level=family_id`,
`candidate_family_scope_oracle_basis=detected_trace_rows_from_candidate_families`,
220 audit-intersection rows, 66 families, and 1520 detected trace candidates
from those families. It selected 20 family cases and passed 20/20，最大
boundary error `0.0830019 min`、最大 area relative error `0.0725986`；再接
explicit
`--low-height-reintegration-stable-activation-scope-audit-tsv` +
`--reintegration-stability-audit-tsv` writer，220/220 expected-diff 通過且
duplicate/missing/unexpected/non-eligible/non-written/unchanged/blank 全為 0。
這個 fifth ready slice 新增 199 個不在前四個 writer scope 的 ready cells，
目前五個 ready scope 的 cell-level union 是 439 cells。
This is a release-safety boundary and a historical evidence trail, not a
license to keep broadening Backfill writer scope. The product direction is now
mechanical adjudication plus structured approval coverage, with automatic matrix
writes allowed only for explicitly authorized, expected-diff-passing scopes. The
72-row high-signal, 42-row low-scan, 57-row low-height, 69-row
low-height-low-scan, and 220-row low-height reintegration-stable slices remain
demonstrators for approved evidence classes, not templates for mining broader
writer predicates.
Shape-clean reintegration-stable is now a cleaner candidate evidence class, but
not a writer promotion. Formal target
`standard_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace` requires
reintegration-stability eligibility and activation-scope shape similarity
`>=0.95`; the no-RAW 85RAW family-level oracle under
`heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_family/`
records 104 audit-intersection rows / 33 families, 334 available detected trace
candidates / 31 families, selected 20/20 pass, max boundary error
`0.0830019 min`, and max area relative error `0.0725986`. A temporary writer
probe was intentionally not retained because it found `matrix_cells_written=0`
and `unchanged_delta_row_count=104`: those rows already have baseline matrix
values, so this evidence can explain policy decisions but cannot claim a new
`production_ready` writer until it targets actual missing cells or another
explicit product contract. The generated policy engine now records this class in
`backfill_policy_candidate_evidence_class` only: the prior shape-clean
explanation replay, before the row-specific observed-oracle bridge, had
439 `write_ready`, 72 `detected_flagged`, and 4102 `blocked`, with 439/439
writer expected-diff pass; 104 rows carried `shape_clean_reintegration_stable`
candidate evidence. At that point, by authority/decision, 30 of those rows were
`review_only` / `detected_flagged`, while 74 were already `writer_approved` /
`write_ready` through existing approved evidence classes.
The Backfill writer path now has a generated policy-engine entry point:
`--backfill-policy-source-audit-tsv` consumes a broad activation scope audit,
optionally joins reintegration-stability evidence, writes
`standard_peak_backfill_policy.tsv`, and classifies every supplied candidate as
`write_ready`, `detected_flagged`, or `blocked`. The writer only replays
generated `write_ready` rows through the existing matrix-only activation and
expected-diff gate. This removes the manual-TSV/white-list failure mode for
already-approved evidence classes; it is not a broadening mechanism and must not
grant authority to new predicates without a later authority manifest update,
independent truth basis, and expected-diff contract. The first generated-policy replay over the
existing 4613-row consolidated source audit passed with 439 generated
`write_ready` rows, 72 `detected_flagged`, and 4102 `blocked`; the product
writer wrote exactly the 439 then-approved evidence rows and
`backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` expected-diff passed with zero blockers. The
latest observed-oracle replay extends that writer surface to 511 `write_ready`
rows and 0 `detected_flagged`, described below. The generated policy schema is
now
`standard_peak_backfill_policy_v2`: every row carries decision-basis,
candidate-evidence, blocker, and next-evidence fields. The generated policy
explanation replay had `0` rows missing explanation; after the observed-oracle
bridge, next-evidence counts are 511 already approved, 1087 needing trace
overlay or reintegration evidence, and 3015 needing a new approved evidence
class or passing oracle.
The same generated policy path now also accepts a machine-generated paired
`--policy-observed-oracle-tsv` / `--policy-observed-oracle-summary-json`
evidence packet. This is not a manual allowlist: the oracle TSV must use
`standard_peak_policy_observed_oracle_v1`, the summary must bind the oracle TSV
SHA, source activation-scope audit SHA, and base generated-policy SHA, row SHA
must match the source audit row, the oracle must be `pass` and
`included_in_product_acceptance=TRUE`, and the source row must still be written
and trace matched. The current no-RAW 85RAW oracle under
`policy_observed_oracle_detected_flagged_full_trace/` evaluated the 72 previous
`detected_flagged` rows by full stored-trace reintegration and passed 72/72
within `0.1 min / 10% area` (max boundary error `8.91875e-05 min`, max area
relative error `0.098218`). The follow-up generated-policy replay under
`generated_policy_policy_observed_oracle_no_raw_productization/` classified the
4613 source-audit rows as 511 `write_ready`, 0 `detected_flagged`, and 4102
`blocked`, wrote exactly 511 matrix cells, and
`backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` expected-diff passed 511/511 with zero
duplicate/missing/unexpected/non-eligible/non-written/unchanged/blank blockers.
This extends `production_ready` to the current approved evidence classes plus
`policy_observed_full_trace_reintegration`; it still does not claim broad
4613-row `production_ready`.
The latest generated-policy replay now also writes an explanation-only quality
sidecar,
`standard_peak_backfill_policy_quality_explanations.tsv`, under
`generated_policy_quality_explained_no_raw_productization/`. This sidecar keeps
the generated policy rows unchanged and does not add writer authority; it only
records source-audit quality blockers for human/debug review. The replay kept
the same product decision surface: 4613 policy rows, 511 `write_ready`, 0
`detected_flagged`, 4102 `blocked`, 511 matrix writes, and 511/511
expected-diff pass. The policy summary now records
`backfill_policy_quality_explanation_row_count=4613`, matching the sidecar TSV.
The most common blocked bucket remains the 1087 rows with missing overlay path,
and the remaining blocked rows mainly carry combined shape/height/width/scan/
apex-delta blockers or still need a new approved evidence class/passing oracle.
The Backfill Production Gate research input under `docs/deepresearch/` reviewed
on 2026-06-17 reinforces that `height >= 2e6` is only a high-signal
demonstrator / rollout guardrail, not a product hard gate. Low-height
`19/20 pass + 1 boundary fail` should be treated as boundary/reintegration risk
evidence. This research input is now background for future truth/review design,
not a prompt to create another broad writer slice.
The 2026-06-18 strategy reset under
`docs/superpowers/notes/2026-06-18-chatgpt_reset_backfill_productization_objective.md`,
`docs/superpowers/notes/2026-06-18-backfill-autowrite-ground-truth-strategy-note.md`,
and
`docs/superpowers/notes/2026-06-18-backfill-autowrite-ground-truth-critical-review.md`
supersedes any next step that would choose another writer slice directly from
`quality_blockers`. The Backfill north star is mechanical adjudication of all
4613 candidates, not claiming all 4613 as writable. Current writer authority
stays at 511 approved cells. The 3015 dirty-but-trace-matched rows are now a
truth/review/adjudication target, not an auto-write pool, and the 1087
`missing_overlay_path` rows stay blocked until trace evidence exists. The
read-only
`backfill_broad_autowrite_feasibility_gate_v1` packet now closes this branch as
`park_broad_backfill`: existing artifacts do not support a short defensible
broad auto-write gate, and ISTD evidence cannot prove analyte peak-choice or
area truth. No broader ProductWriter authority should be implemented, and no
new broad Backfill sidecars/diagnostics should be added unless a genuinely new
independent truth source is named. The current next asset is
`productization_authority_manifest_v1` plus
`mechanical_adjudication_schema_v1` / `mechanical_adjudication_index_v1`: a
fail-closed authority and classification layer that makes all 4613 rows
machine-adjudicated without granting new writer authority.
The next checkpoint adds Review Packet / Approval Workflow v1 as a structured
human-review asset, not ProductWriter authority: the 3015 trace-matched
unresolved rows become review packets, the 1087 missing-overlay rows remain
evidence-recovery work, and reviewer approval can only write a decision log.
Peak-Choice Truth Set / Lockbox v1 then adds the first independent truth-label
acquisition contract: 72 deterministic cases across approved controls,
unresolved review rows, missing-overlay evidence gaps, failed-oracle negatives,
and manual wrong-peak/no-peak fixtures. It is `production_candidate` as a
non-mutating truth/review asset only; no labels have been collected, agreement
metrics are null, and lockbox membership cannot grant ProductWriter authority.
Lockbox Label Collection Pack v1 now materializes that lockbox as a
human-labelable package: 72 Markdown review packets, a 144-row empty label
template with two reviewer slots per case, a strict label schema, a validator,
and a plain-language labeling README. This still does not create truth labels
or write authority. Blank template rows are not labels; future reviewer labels
remain evidence inputs until a later import/summary gate and separate
expected-diff authority update say otherwise.
Lockbox Static Review UX v1 now adds a human-readable HTML bundle on top of the
same label package: 72 case pages, 53 Gaussian15-smoothed review plots with
Gaussian-derived review boundaries, 18 explicit missing-evidence pages, and 1
trace-present boundary-unavailable page. Gaussian15 is a review/morphology view
only; it is not a ProductWriter input, matrix area, selected peak switch,
counted-detection decision, or automatic truth label. The teal shaded review
window is Gaussian-derived; older candidate/raw boundaries are reference lines
only.
Lockbox Next-Action Plan v1 now splits the first one-reviewer import into
actionable, non-authoritative buckets: 53 plotted Gaussian15 cases are ready for
second independent review; 6 manual wrong-peak/no-peak cases are existing
negative controls, not missing-evidence unknowns; 12 failed round-trip oracle
negative cases stay parked because the oracle is not independent peak-choice or
area truth; and 1 Gaussian boundary-unavailable case needs signal/evidence
recovery or remains not assessable. This split narrows the next human step
without granting ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected-peak, selected-area,
counted-detection, GUI, or broad Backfill authority.
Lockbox Shadow Scoring Contract Adapter v1 turns that split plus the
single-owner/AI-challenge closure into a 72-case shadow-only contract manifest:
53 owner-clean Gaussian15 cases are non-authoritative accept challenges, 6
manual wrong-peak/no-peak controls are reject hard stops, and 13 excluded rows
remain `not_scored`. The adapter records shadow/truth/doublet/source-hash and
manifest-sha contract fields plus the Gaussian15 boundary policy explicitly:
Gaussian-smoothed boundaries are the review basis; raw-trace doublets are
acceptable only when the Backfill/detect reference is on the left peak, and
unclear or right-peak reference cases stay flagged. This is still
`production_candidate` evidence/control infrastructure only. Phase 2
`ProductionAcceptanceManifest v1` is now defined as an additive schema/checker
precursor; it is not a scorer run and writes no ProductWriter input, matrix,
workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection, reviewer slot2, GUI, default
extraction, or broad Backfill authority. Phase 3 `QuantMatrixVersion Activation`
is now implemented as an explicit manifest-driven activation surface with
expected-diff, `cell_provenance`, and `row_summary`; it still does not wire
ProductWriter default extraction, workbooks, GUI, selected peak/area, counted
detection, reviewer slot2, or broad Backfill authority. Phase 4
`Gallery/Report Alignment` is now implemented as a review-only report surface
over `QuantMatrixVersion` outputs and the validated manifest; it exposes
accepted Backfill versus detected cells, prevalence risk, manual-negative and
doublet closure, source paths/hashes, manifest sha, and the Gaussian-smoothed
trace-primary/raw-trace-auxiliary convention without granting ProductWriter,
matrix, workbook, GUI, selected peak/area, counted detection, reviewer slot2,
or broad Backfill authority. Phase 5 `Validation/Promotion Readiness` is now
implemented as a read-only promotion checker: it separates contract correctness
from scientific confidence, writes readiness summary/check sidecars, and cannot
claim `production_ready` from focused tests, 8RAW smoke evidence, or unbound
tier/status strings alone. Required science pass rows must bind artifact relpath,
SHA, and tier-specific provenance such as cohort/run, oracle packet, or
downstream scope. `QuantMatrix Promotion Validation Packet v1` now materializes
the first no-RAW evidence packet from existing artifacts: large-cohort and
heldout-oracle evidence are artifact-bound and pass, while downstream-impact
evidence is explicitly missing, so the Phase 5 readiness fixture remains
`contract_ready_science_inconclusive` with
`may_promote_default_quant_matrix=false`. Phase 6 now defines the no-RAW
`QuantMatrix downstream-impact smoke` contract: a downstream artifact must
prove that a real `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle improves numeric matrix coverage
while preserving detected-only claims through sidecars; contract fixtures and
tier strings cannot satisfy promotion. Phase 7 assembled the current real
511-cell `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle from
`seed-guard-realdata-85raw-generated-policy-policy-observed-oracle-20260617`
and confirmed contract correctness plus downstream-impact smoke, while keeping
readiness science-inconclusive until evidence was rebound. Phase 8 now binds
that real downstream-impact artifact together with the existing large-cohort
and heldout-oracle artifacts into `QuantMatrix Promotion Packet v2`; real-bundle
readiness is `production_ready_candidate_packet` with `production_ready=true`
and `may_promote_default_quant_matrix=true`. At that point it was a candidate
promotion packet only: ProductWriter default extraction, default matrix
authority, workbook/GUI behavior, selected peak/area, counted detection, and
broad Backfill authority remained unchanged until the later expected-diff
activation gate described below.
The default matrix authority phrase here is retained as a productization-state
anchor for the Phase 8 boundary, as is the later expected-diff activation gate
phrase.
Phase 9 now adds that no-RAW default activation dry-run expected-diff gate:
manifest-driven activation is rerun in a temporary directory and matches the
Phase 7 reference `quant_matrix`, `cell_provenance`, `row_summary`, and
`expected_diff_summary` hashes exactly, with 511 expected, 511 written, and 0
unused expected-diff rows. The gate allows Product Ready closeout review to
proceed, but it still writes no default matrix files and changes no
ProductWriter/default behavior.
Phase 10 closes that evidence chain as
`product_ready_default_matrix_candidate`: Phase 8 and Phase 9 both validate,
the closeout checklist has six passing checks, and the activation contract is
ready for a separate explicit ProductWriter activation commit. This does not
itself change default outputs, workbook/GUI, selected peak/area, counted
detection, current 511-cell authority, or broad Backfill status.
Phase 11 now performs that explicit ProductWriter/default output activation:
the default output `quant_matrix.tsv` is written from the current
ProductionAcceptanceManifest plus expected-diff contract and contains detected
values plus 511 accepted Backfill quantification values. The activated product
surface also writes `cell_provenance`, `row_summary`, `expected_diff_summary`,
and `source_summary`; the summary is
`product_ready_default_matrix_activated`, with 17489 detected cells, 511
accepted Backfill cells, 18000 quant-available cells, and zero unused
expected-diff rows. This activates the current 511-cell default matrix output
only; it does not change workbook/GUI behavior, selected peak, selected area,
counted detection, review/replay behavior, broad Backfill status, or the
registered product authority scope.
The `d4-N6-2HE-dA` target-row identity stop-ship is now traced to discovery
MS2 seed extraction, not ProductWriter or Backfill: Thermo MS2 filter precursor
can be an isolation/trigger mass, so CID-NL discovery must allow
product-plus-neutral-loss inferred precursor seeds within
`ms2_precursor_tol_da`. The discovery path now emits inferred
`300.160x / 184.113` seeds without deleting valid `301.165 / 185.116` isotope
seeds, and discovery `candidate_id` includes precursor/product row identity to
avoid same-scan candidate collisions. This fixes the generation path only; the
already activated default matrix bundle remains stale for this target until a
later explicit discovery/alignment/default-activation expected-diff rerun.
Missing-Overlay Evidence Recovery v1 now links the 1087
`missing_overlay_path` rows back to existing family-level trace/overlay
artifacts and sample-level trace fields across 114 families. This moves the
evidence explanation from "artifact link missing" to "trace recovered but still
needs review/truth/reintegration decision"; it does not grant write authority.
Goal 5 machine status lane ids are tracked in
`docs/superpowers/validation/productization_status_index_v1.tsv`:
`backfill_current_write_ready_scope`, `broad_backfill_autowrite`,
`productization_authority_firewall_v1`, `mechanical_adjudication_contract_v1`,
`review_packet_workflow_v1`, `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`,
`missing_overlay_evidence_recovery_v1`, `quality_explanation_sidecar_v1`,
`targeted_ms1_shape_identity_limited_rescue_v1`,
`targeted_ms1_shape_identity_broader_targets`,
`sample_metadata_order_projection_v1`, `sample_metadata_role_value_behavior`,
`review_action_candidate_sidecar_v1`, `review_action_selected_candidate_switch`,
`review_action_manual_boundary_area_writer`,
`calibration_normalization_activation`, and `gui_replay_parity`.
Goal 6 bounded non-broad acceptance is tracked in
`docs/superpowers/validation/bounded_non_broad_lane_acceptance_v1.tsv` and
checked by `scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`. It does not add product
authority; it only locks the current non-broad lane boundaries: Targeted MS1
limited rescue may stay within `limited_5hmdc_5medc_v1` / `5-hmdC + 5-medC` /
`detected_flagged`, SampleMetadata may stay no-output/order-projection only,
and ReviewAction candidate sidecar may verify identity only. Broader Targeted
MS1 targets, role-driven value behavior, selected-candidate switch, and
manual-boundary area writer remain blocked or parked until a separate product
contract plus expected-diff gate exists.
Targeted MS1 shape identity limited rescue 也已收斂成窄範圍
`production_ready`：headless explicit support-TSV workflow、headless
auto-limited CLI、以及 canonical no-flag normal CLI default 都可用，但都只限
`limited_5hmdc_5medc_v1`、`5-hmdC + 5-medC`、且產品輸出只能變成
`detected_flagged`。GUI wiring、以及其他 target 仍不在這個 ready claim 內。
ReviewAction selected candidate / manual boundary writer 已 parked for current
release claim；產品方向仍是減少人工審查，之後要用 stable IDs、
expected-diff、audit gate 重新開 lane，而不是要求使用者審完所有案例。
sample metadata cross-module
parity 的 no-output resolver slices 已收斂到 `production_ready` for
order projection only：extraction、instrument-QC、alignment、RT-normalization
anchor diagnostic 都可用同一個 `sample_metadata_v1` resolver 或 sidecar；
sample roles / blank / QC / batch / matrix / exclusion 仍 `blocked` for any
value-changing behavior，不可直接改 quant、counted detection、normalized value
或 main matrix。

Hard gate: a lane without a `WIP owner`, productization intake packet, and stop
rule must not enter implementation. Hooks only remind; this table decides active
scope.

## Non-negotiable rule

任何功能不得被稱為 `production_surface`，除非同時滿足以下條件:

- 有明確 public surface: CLI flag、GUI control、config key、CSV/TSV/XLSX schema、report contract、或 downstream handoff。
- 有一個 domain authority owner: 例如 `EvidenceVector`、`PeakHypothesis`、`ProductionDecisionSet`、canonical projection adapter，而不是 writer/report 自己重算決策。
- 有 schema 或 output contract: 欄位、enum、sheet order、hidden state、metadata key、或 JSON schema 必須可檢查。
- 有 replay/provenance: 至少能說出 inputs、config/settings、target/sample metadata、runtime/backend、version/hash。
- 有 focused tests 或 validation gate: 不只 synthetic smoke；若會改 selected area、counted detection、primary matrix，必須有 expected-diff。
- 有 rollback/stop rule: 失敗時知道是退回 shadow、保留 diagnostic，還是 kill 掉。

少一項，最高只能叫 `production_candidate`。如果會改 primary matrix 但缺 expected-diff，最高只能叫 `shadow_ready`。

## Maturity labels

| Label | 可宣稱什麼 | 不可宣稱什麼 | Exit rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `missing` | 需求存在，尚未有穩定實作。 | 不可寫進 user-facing feature list。 | 寫 spec 或明確 kill。 |
| `partial_internal` | 內部模型/helper 存在。 | 不可當 public contract。 | 收斂到 owner/adaptor，或保留內部。 |
| `diagnostic_only` | 可調查、比較、產出 evidence。 | 不可改 product output；不可當 release feature。 | promote to shadow、kill、或外部化為工具。 |
| `shadow_ready` | 可 side-by-side 比較；主輸出不變。 | 不可 silent promotion；不可改 counted detection/primary matrix。 | expected-diff + activation contract。 |
| `production_candidate` | code/tests 接近正式；可以做 gated rollout。 | 不可宣稱 fully production-ready。 | schema/replay/review gate 通過。 |
| `production_surface` | 使用者或下游可依賴的正式 surface。 | 不代表 science readiness 已滿；仍要標驗證範圍。 | 納入 regression/release gate。 |
| `production_ready` | 可作正式 release claim。 | 不可只靠單一小 fixture 或 docs。 | 至少通過指定 fixture、expected-diff、downstream smoke。 |

Backfill row update, 2026-06-18: the long table row above is historical for the
approved 511-cell writer surface and prior probes. The broad 4613-row
auto-write branch is now superseded by
`backfill_broad_autowrite_feasibility_gate_v1` and is `parked`; do not follow
the older "next broadening step" wording without a new independent truth source.

Backfill row update, 2026-06-17: the low-height evidence is no longer only the
old full-trace 19/20 failure. The diagnostic heldout oracle now has an
`expected_window_bounded` observed reintegration mode; no-RAW replay on the
same 85RAW trace artifacts shows `padding=0.5 min` passes selected 20/20 with
max boundary error `0.0857986 min` and max area relative error `0.0564106`.
That evidence has now been connected to an explicit low-height writer flag:
`narrow_low_height_clean_no_raw_productization/narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json`
passes 57/57 with `readiness_tier=production_ready`. This authorizes only the
explicit 57-row low-height scoped writer, not broad 4613-row activation or
default extraction behavior.

Backfill row update, 2026-06-17: the low-height-low-scan intersection is now a
separate explicit scoped writer. This class requires height <2e6, scan count
7-9, and otherwise clean shape/local-global/width/apex evidence. The formal
no-RAW 85RAW bounded heldout oracle
`heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_low_height_low_scan_clean_probe/summary.json`
passes selected 20/20 from 210 eligible rows / 51 families, with max boundary
error `4.80376e-05 min` and max area relative error `0.00881912`. The explicit
writer run
`narrow_low_height_low_scan_clean_no_raw_productization/narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json`
passes 69/69 with `readiness_tier=production_ready`. This authorizes only the
explicit 69-row low-height-low-scan scoped writer, not broad 4613-row activation
or default extraction behavior.

Backfill row update, 2026-06-17: boundary-stability / reintegration-agreement is
now a named broader diagnostic evidence class. The first full no-RAW 85RAW run
`reintegration_stability_audit/` scans the committed 4613-row activation scope
and reports 299 eligible written rows, 3227 ineligible written rows, and 1087
missing-evidence rows. Of those 299 eligible rows, 271 are outside the four
currently production-ready scoped writer envelopes. This is stronger broad
`production_candidate` evidence only: no writer flag exists, no matrix output is
changed, and masked/product-writer oracle plus expected-diff approval are still
required before any activation claim. Subagent review caught that `status=pass`
was too easy to misread as writer approval; the summary now fails closed with
`status=candidate_pool_blocked`, `writer_authority_status=blocked`, and upstream
activation-scope schema/source_run_id/SHA provenance.

Backfill row update, 2026-06-17: low-height reintegration-stable is now the
fifth explicit scoped writer. It is not the full 299-row stability pool. The
formal family-scope heldout oracle
`heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_low_height_reintegration_stable_family/`
uses the 299-row stability audit plus the current combined activation scope
audit to select only stability-eligible written rows with `cell_height <2e6`;
that gives 220 audit-intersection rows / 66 families. The oracle then expands
only to detected trace rows from those same families
(`candidate_family_scope_match_level=family_id`; 1520 available candidates),
selected 20 family cases, and passed 20/20 under the accepted
`0.1 min / 10% area` ceiling, with
max boundary error `0.0830019 min` and max area relative error `0.0725986`.
The explicit writer
`narrow_low_height_reintegration_stable_no_raw_productization/` then selected
and wrote exactly 220 cells from the pre-standard-backfill matrix and passed
`narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json` 220/220 with
`readiness_tier=production_ready`. This adds 199 cells outside the previous
four ready scopes; the five-scope ready union is now 439 cells. The broad
4613-row activation and the all-stability 299-row pool remain
`production_candidate` / writer-blocked because the formal all-stability
family oracle failed one selected case above the accepted area tolerance.

Backfill row update, 2026-06-17: shape-clean reintegration-stable is now
recorded as a `production_candidate` evidence class, not a writer. The formal
target `standard_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace`
filters the stability/activation intersection to rows with
`apex_aligned_shape_similarity >=0.95`; the real no-RAW 85RAW oracle
`heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_family/`
records 104 audit-intersection rows / 33 families, 334 available detected trace
candidates / 31 families, and selected 20/20 pass with max boundary error
`0.0830019 min` and max area relative error `0.0725986`. A local writer probe
with temporary wiring was intentionally removed before commit because it found
0 new matrix writes and 104 unchanged/pre-existing matrix values. This scope can
inform generated-policy explanation or a future missing-cell scope, but it is
not product writer authority.

## WIP limits

目前開發節奏拖慢的主因不是缺想法，而是同時開太多 diagnostic/spec，沒有把其中少數推完。

每個 2 週維護週期最多允許:

- 1 個 primary productization lane。
- 1 個 supporting infrastructure lane。
- 1 個 diagnostic-only lane。

若要新增 lane，必須先把現有 lane 之一改成:

- `production_surface`
- `shadow_ready` with explicit next gate
- `diagnostic_only` archived with kill/externalize decision
- abandoned with reason

## Weekly maintenance checklist

建議每週固定一次，或每次重大 PR 收尾後執行。

### 1. Board hygiene

- [ ] `Active productization board` 每一列的 tier 是否仍準確。
- [ ] 有沒有功能在聊天、README、報告、PR 中被過度宣稱。
- [ ] 新增的 diagnostic/report/sidecar 是否有 exit rule。
- [ ] `WIP owner` 是否明確；沒有 owner 的 lane 不應進入 active implementation。
- [ ] 有沒有超過 WIP limit。

### 2. Contract hygiene

- [ ] Public surface 是否有 schema/version/required columns。
- [ ] Workbook/CSV/TSV/JSON 欄位變更是否同步 tests。
- [ ] Config key / CLI flag / GUI setting 是否同步 docs。
- [ ] Downstream handoff 是否明確 owner 與 pass-through/exclusion rule。
- [ ] Report 是否只 render，不重新計算 domain decision。

### 3. Promotion hygiene

- [ ] 這週是否有任何 selected peak、area、confidence、reason、counted detection、matrix value 會改變。
- [ ] 若會改變，是否有 expected-diff artifact。
- [ ] 若只在 sidecar，主輸出是否被測試確認不變。
- [ ] 是否有 rollback/stop rule。
- [ ] 是否有 reviewer/audit trail 記錄。

### 4. Validation hygiene

- [ ] 本週 claims 使用的是 synthetic、8RAW、85RAW、targeted benchmark、manual EIC/MS2 review，還是 docs-only。
- [ ] 是否把 tests passing 誤寫成 production readiness。
- [ ] 是否有 large RAW gate 被偷偷跳過。
- [ ] 是否有 downstream workbook/TSV smoke。
- [ ] 是否有 stale output 被當成新 evidence。

### 5. Drift cleanup

- [ ] 舊 spec 是否仍和 runtime reality 一致。
- [ ] 有沒有多份 docs 對同一能力給不同 tier。
- [ ] 有沒有命名造成誤會，例如 `production_candidate_gate` 被誤認為 production promotion。
- [ ] 有沒有 legacy name 應保留為 compatibility，而不是立刻 rename。
- [ ] 是否需要把本週結論回寫到這份 control plane。
- [ ] 是否已同步更新白話交接文件 `docs/superpowers/handoffs/current/cc-framework-improvements-productization.md`。
- [ ] `git status --short -- docs/superpowers/handoffs/current/cc-framework-improvements-productization.md docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-productization-control-plane.md` 是否符合預期；若 handoff 是接手必需品，必須 tracked/ staged/ committed，或明確標成 local-only/non-authoritative。

## Pre-work checklist

任何產品化 task 開始前先填。

- [ ] Review all `diagnostic_only` artifacts older than 30 days.
- [ ] Review all specs/plans with no owner.
- [ ] Update this board with actual tier, not aspirational tier.
- [ ] Write one closeout note summarizing what changed in product surface.

## Historical immediate 2026-06 queue snapshot

This section is retained as a historical queue from the original 2026-06
planning pass. It is not the current WIP table; use `Current medium-term active
lanes` and `Active productization board` above for current owner/tier decisions.
Items below that say `primary lane` or `supporting lane` describe their status
at that older checkpoint, not the latest release claim.

依照 current capability inventory 與當時 replay executor closeout，當時順序為:

1. `method_manifest_v1` - done
   - Result: `production_ready` for targeted CLI replay parity.
   - Evidence: focused tests, 8RAW CSV/workbook replay parity, and one targeted 85RAW initial+replay sequence.
   - Residual: no timestamped workbook hash capture; GUI replay not wired to mainline.

2. `targeted_schema_versioning_v1` - done
   - Reason: mature-tool parity 需要 output schema version，不然下游與 replay 只能猜欄位語意。
   - Result: `production_surface` for additive schema/version contract.
   - Scope: `output/schema.py` constants, manifest `output_schema`, workbook `Run Metadata`; no CSV data-column changes.

3. `review_action_apply_v1` - historical primary lane at this checkpoint
   - Reason: 解決 Review Queue 不能回寫，這是 Skyline parity floor。
   - Current baseline: `production_candidate` for action schema/import validator and dry-run application plan only.
   - Next target: audit/apply loop with expected-diff before touching selected outputs.

4. `sample_metadata_runtime_parity_v1` - historical supporting lane at this checkpoint
   - Reason: normalization/QC/alignment 都需要 sample type、QC、blank、batch、injection order。
   - Current baseline: `production_candidate` for schema/validator only.
   - Next target: project current legacy injection order behavior into the shared resolver with output parity; do not let sample role change matrix behavior in this slice.

5. `alignment_output_contract_v1` - done as contract/docs alignment
   - Reason: `alignment_results.xlsx` 已成熟，但 TSV production/machine wording 需要對齊。
   - Result: `production_surface` for output-level contract.
   - Guard: `alignment_matrix.tsv` remains machine/validation, while `alignment_matrix_identity.tsv` is a production-level identity handoff.

暫時不要優先做:

- 新 peak picker。
- 新 diagnostic gallery。
- 新 shadow sidecar。
- normalization/calibration main-matrix write。
- backfill product-authority primary matrix activation。

除非 `Current medium-term active lanes` 先把其中一個 lane 解凍，且該 lane 已經有 owner、spec、promotion packet，否則新增這些只會增加未收斂面積。

## Maintenance log

新增產品化狀態變更時，在這裡 append。格式:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD - <lane>

- Previous tier:
- New tier:
- Evidence:
- Product surface changed:
- Validation:
- Remaining blocker:
```

### 2026-06-15 - Control plane initialized

- Previous tier: none
- New tier: living maintenance checklist
- Evidence: current capability inventory and five-area read-only review
- Product surface changed: none
- Validation: document smoke only
- Remaining blocker: no active owner assigned to the first four June focus specs

### 2026-06-15 - method_manifest_v1

- Previous tier: `missing`
- New tier: `production_ready` for targeted CLI replay parity; not full exact artifact replay
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-method-manifest-v1-spec.md`; `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-06-15-replay-executor-validation-note.md`; `xic_extractor.output.method_manifest`; `xic-extractor-cli --replay-manifest`; focused manifest/output metadata/CLI replay tests; targeted 8RAW and 85RAW CSV/workbook replay parity; post-review test that replay rejects settings/targets artifact paths that do not bind to `invocation.config_dir`
- Product surface changed: additive `output/method_manifest.json`; additive workbook `Run Metadata` rows `method_manifest_schema`, `method_manifest_path`, `method_manifest_sha256`; additive `--replay-manifest` CLI mode
- Validation: synthetic/focused unit, output contract, CLI replay tests, targeted 8RAW CSV-only replay byte parity, targeted 8RAW Excel-mode workbook compare, and one targeted 85RAW initial+replay sequence with CSV byte parity plus workbook compare
- Remaining blocker: no timestamped workbook hash capture for full exact artifact replay; GUI parity intentionally skipped because GUI replay is not yet wired to mainline

### 2026-06-15 - targeted_schema_versioning_v1

- Previous tier: `missing` as an explicit targeted output schema contract
- New tier: `production_surface` for additive schema/version metadata
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.output.schema` version constants; `method_manifest.json` `output_schema`; workbook `Run Metadata` row `targeted_output_schema_version`
- Product surface changed: additive `targeted_output_schema_version` metadata row and additive manifest `output_schema` block; no CSV data-column changes
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_output_schema_contract.py tests\test_output_metadata.py tests\test_method_manifest.py -q`
- Remaining blocker: downstream export profiles still need a handoff profile; schema version is surfaced through manifest/metadata, not embedded as a row-level CSV column

### 2026-06-15 - review_action_import_and_application_plan_v1

- Previous tier: `missing`
- New tier: `production_candidate` for ReviewAction import validation, dry-run application plan, expected-diff approval template/loader, apply-readiness planning, and changeset planning only
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-review-roundtrip-v1-spec.md`; `xic_extractor.review_actions`; `scripts/validate_review_actions.py`; `scripts/plan_review_action_applications.py`; `scripts/validate_review_action_expected_diffs.py`; `scripts/plan_review_action_apply_readiness.py`; `scripts/plan_review_action_apply_changesets.py`; post-review stale-approval guard that blocks expected-diff approvals when the current targeted row no longer matches the approved baseline state
- Product surface changed: additive `review_action_v1` TSV/CSV schema, validator CLI, additive `review_action_application_plan_v1` dry-run TSV, optional `review_action_expected_diff_v1` template TSV with baseline target-state columns, expected-diff approval loader, approval validator CLI, additive `review_action_apply_readiness_v1` TSV planner, and additive `review_action_apply_changeset_v1` TSV planner; no extraction output mutation
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_review_actions.py -q`; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor\review_actions.py scripts\validate_review_actions.py scripts\plan_review_action_applications.py scripts\validate_review_action_expected_diffs.py scripts\plan_review_action_apply_readiness.py scripts\plan_review_action_apply_changesets.py tests\test_review_actions.py`; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor\review_actions.py scripts\validate_review_actions.py scripts\plan_review_action_applications.py scripts\validate_review_action_expected_diffs.py scripts\plan_review_action_apply_readiness.py scripts\plan_review_action_apply_changesets.py`
- Remaining blocker: no product-writing action application/reintegration loop, no manual boundary recompute, no selected candidate switch writer, no audited output writer that consumes changeset rows

### 2026-06-15 - sample_metadata_contract_v1

- Previous tier: `partial_internal`
- New tier: `production_candidate` for shared schema/validator only
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-sample-metadata-contract-v1-spec.md`; `xic_extractor.sample_metadata`; `scripts/validate_sample_metadata.py`; post-review alias-collision tests for shared `sample_name`/`raw_stem` injection-order namespace
- Product surface changed: additive `sample_metadata_v1` TSV/CSV schema and validator CLI; no extraction/QC/alignment runtime change
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_sample_metadata.py -q`; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor\sample_metadata.py scripts\validate_sample_metadata.py tests\test_sample_metadata.py`; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor\sample_metadata.py scripts\validate_sample_metadata.py`
- Remaining blocker: extraction still reads legacy `injection_order_source`; instrument-QC sequence manifest is not yet projected into `sample_metadata_v1`; alignment and normalization do not consume this resolver; sample roles cannot alter matrix values without expected-diff gates

### 2026-06-16 - review_action_audited_apply_copy_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for import/apply-readiness/changeset planning only
- New tier: `production_surface` for audited targeted-long output copy and `review_action_apply_audit_v1`
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.review_actions`; `scripts/apply_review_action_changesets.py`; `tests/test_review_actions.py`
- Product surface changed: additive CLI that consumes `review_action_apply_changeset_v1` and writes an audited targeted-long copy plus audit TSV. The command refuses input overwrite and rejects blocked changesets by default.
- Safe behavior boundary: `accept_current` is audit-only; `mark_unresolved` writes only `Review State = unresolved_by_review`; `reject_current` may write `Product State = rejected_by_review`, `Counted Detection = FALSE`, and `Review State = rejected_by_review` only after approved expected-diff. `select_candidate` and `set_manual_boundary` remain deferred because they need candidate sidecar or area recompute.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_review_actions.py -q`
- Remaining blocker: no selected-candidate switch writer, no manual-boundary area recompute writer, no workbook or primary matrix rewrite.

### 2026-06-16 - sample_metadata_runtime_parity_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for schema/validator only
- New tier: `production_surface` for extraction injection-order parity; `production_candidate` for roles/batch/matrix/exclusion semantics
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.sample_metadata`; `xic_extractor.extraction.pipeline.resolve_injection_order`; `tests/test_sample_metadata.py`; `tests/test_extractor_run.py`
- Product surface changed: existing `injection_order_source` can now point to a `sample_metadata_v1` CSV/TSV. Legacy `Sample_Name,Injection_Order` files still use the legacy parser.
- Safe behavior boundary: only injection-order mapping is projected; `sample_role`, batch, matrix, group, and exclusion fields do not alter extraction output, counted detection, or matrix values.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_sample_metadata.py tests\test_injection_rolling.py tests\test_extractor_run.py -q`
- Remaining blocker: instrument-QC, alignment, and normalization do not yet consume the shared sample metadata resolver.

### 2026-06-16 - review_action_reintegration_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for deferred changeset rows; selected-candidate switch and manual-boundary area recompute deferred
- New tier: `parked`; audited apply copy remains `production_surface`, deferred changesets remain `production_candidate`
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-15-review-roundtrip-v1-spec.md`; current `xic_extractor.review_actions` apply path records `select_candidate` and `set_manual_boundary` as deferred operations only
- Product surface changed: none this round
- Validation: no code path changed in this lane this round
- Remaining blocker: human product decision and expected-diff acceptance are required before any writer may change selected peak, selected area, workbook, primary matrix, or counted detection for these actions

### 2026-06-17 - review_action_candidate_sidecar_verifier_v1

- Lane: `review_action_reintegration_v1`.
- Previous tier: selected-candidate switch was `parked`; candidate identity could
  only appear as a free `candidate_id` string inside ReviewAction/expected-diff
  rows.
- New tier: `production_candidate` for candidate-sidecar verification only.
  Selected-candidate switch and manual-boundary area recompute remain parked.
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.review_actions` now defines
  `review_action_candidate_sidecar_v1`; `scripts/plan_review_action_candidate_sidecars.py`
  reads `review_action_v1` plus targeted `peak_candidates.tsv`, verifies that
  each `select_candidate` action's `candidate_id` is present and unique for the
  same sample/target, records a candidate row SHA-256 plus RT/area/confidence
  audit fields, and fails closed for multiple `select_candidate` actions on the
  same target, missing target rows, missing candidates, or duplicate candidate
  ids.
- Product surface changed: additive CLI and additive TSV schema only. No
  selected peak, selected area, counted detection, workbook, primary matrix, or
  extraction output is changed.
- Validation: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_review_actions.py -q`
  (`32 passed`); focused ruff/mypy for `xic_extractor\review_actions.py`,
  `scripts\plan_review_action_candidate_sidecars.py`, and
  `tests\test_review_actions.py`.
- Remaining blocker: a future product-writing selected-candidate switch still
  needs an explicit expected-diff/apply contract that consumes the verified
  candidate sidecar row. Manual boundary still needs an area recompute writer and
  product decision.
- Next checkpoint: if reopening ReviewAction mutation, consume
  `review_action_candidate_sidecar_v1` together with approved expected-diff; do
  not infer candidate identity from workbook display text.

### 2026-06-16 - sample_metadata_instrument_qc_projection_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for roles/batch/matrix metadata outside extraction
- New tier: `production_surface` for additive instrument-QC `sample_metadata_v1` sidecar; roles remain non-mutating metadata only
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.instrument_qc.sequence_manifest_writers.write_sample_metadata_tsv`; `scripts/run_instrument_qc.py --method-doc`; `tests/test_instrument_qc_sequence_manifest.py`; `tests/test_run_instrument_qc.py`
- Product surface changed: additive `instrument_qc_sample_metadata.tsv` written next to `instrument_qc_sequence_manifest.tsv` and `instrument_qc_injection_order.csv` when `--method-doc` is used. It includes actual matched RAW rows and raw-dir-only instrument-QC rows, maps instrument-QC class to `sample_role`, and does not feed role metadata into quant behavior.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_instrument_qc_sequence_manifest.py tests\test_run_instrument_qc.py -q`; touched-file ruff/mypy passed
- Remaining blocker: alignment and normalization still do not consume the shared resolver; sample roles/exclusions must not alter matrix values without a separate expected-diff gate

### 2026-06-17 - sample_metadata_alignment_column_order_v1

- Previous tier: `production_surface` for extraction injection-order parity and instrument-QC sidecar; alignment remained a resolver-parity blocker
- New tier: `production_surface` for alignment sample-column injection-order parity; roles remain non-mutating metadata only
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.alignment.pipeline.run_alignment`; `scripts/run_alignment.py --sample-column-injection-order`; `tests/test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py`
- Product surface changed: `--sample-column-injection-order` may now receive a `sample_metadata_v1` CSV/TSV in addition to legacy `Sample_Name,Injection_Order` CSV/XLSX. The shared metadata parser projects `sample_name`/`raw_stem` aliases into the same injection-order mapping used for final matrix/status sample-column ordering.
- Safe behavior boundary: this reorders output sample columns only when the user explicitly supplies the input path. Sample roles, exclusions, batch, matrix type, and group still do not alter matrix values, counted detection, feature acceptance, or backfill activation.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_pipeline_orders_sample_columns_by_sample_metadata_v1 tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_pipeline_orders_sample_columns_by_injection_order tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_pipeline_keeps_input_sample_order_without_injection_source -q`; touched-file ruff passed
- Remaining blocker: normalization still does not consume the shared resolver; sample roles/exclusions must not alter matrix values without a separate expected-diff gate

### 2026-06-17 - sample_metadata_rt_normalization_anchor_resolver_v1

- Previous tier: `production_surface` for extraction/alignment injection-order parity and instrument-QC sidecar; RT-normalization anchor diagnostic remained a resolver-parity blocker
- New tier: `production_surface` for RT-normalization anchor diagnostic injection-order parity; roles remain non-mutating metadata only
- Evidence: `tools/diagnostics/rt_normalization_anchor_loaders.py`; `tools/diagnostics/analyze_rt_normalization_anchors.py --sample-info`; `tests/test_rt_normalization_anchors.py`
- Product surface changed: `--sample-info` for injection-based RT-normalization anchor references may now receive a `sample_metadata_v1` CSV/TSV in addition to legacy `Sample_Name,Injection_Order` input. The diagnostic projects `sample_name`/`raw_stem` aliases into the same injection-order mapping used by legacy rolling-anchor references.
- Safe behavior boundary: this affects only injection-order lookup for `injection-local-median` and `injection-loess` RT-normalization anchor diagnostics. Sample roles, exclusions, batch, matrix type, and group do not alter normalized values, matrix values, counted detection, feature acceptance, or calibration/main-matrix writes.
- Validation: `uv run pytest tests\test_rt_normalization_anchors.py -q` (`16 passed`); `uv run ruff check tools\diagnostics\rt_normalization_anchor_loaders.py tests\test_rt_normalization_anchors.py` (`All checks passed!`); `uv run mypy tools\diagnostics\rt_normalization_anchor_loaders.py` (`Success: no issues found in 1 source file`); subagent reviewer `Descartes` found no P1/P2 blocker and the P3 request to cover `injection-loess` parity was fixed.
- Remaining blocker: role-aware QC/blank/batch/matrix behavior and calibration/normalization writes remain blocked until a separate expected-diff gate and product decision exist.

### 2026-06-16 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_explicit_optin_v1

- Previous tier: `diagnostic_only` for shared MS1 shape evidence; explicit opt-in workflow pending tier decision
- New tier: `production_candidate` for explicit support-TSV workflow only
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-shared-target-untarget-peak-identity-spine-spec.md`; 8RAW expected-diff artifact `output/ms1_shape_identity_optin_8raw_20260616/expected_diff_summary.tsv`; 85RAW manual-support and generic-support artifacts under `output/ms1_shape_identity_optin_85raw_20260616/` and `output/ms1_shape_identity_generic_support_85raw_20260616/`
- Product surface changed: none this round; existing explicit config/CLI support path remains opt-in
- Validation: reused existing 8RAW/85RAW artifacts; no new 85RAW run because the existing artifacts already answer the candidate-tier decision
- Remaining blocker: default automatic support generation/consumption remains
  off. Broader target expansion, default extraction, and GUI rescue remain not
  production-ready.

### 2026-06-16 - standard_peak_seed_guard_v1

- Previous tier: `shadow_ready` for backfill product-authority sidecars; seed guard spec was `implementation_candidate`
- New tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard slice only
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs`; `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_backfill_productization`; additive `seed_guard_decisions.tsv`; heldout oracle result schema/evaluator; `tests/test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py`; `tests/test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py`
- Product surface changed: standard-peak matrix activation now evaluates standard-path promotion candidates against N-band seed support before writing activation decisions. The acceptance artifact proves candidate coverage, low-seed no-write expectations, and actual write attribution through `activation_value_delta.tsv`. No workbook schema, review-row enum, primary alignment schema, or non-standard peak policy changed.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`; touched-file ruff/mypy passed
- Remaining blocker: production-ready still needs heldout oracle result rows from real/reviewed cases plus an 85RAW expected-diff gate. Non-standard peak automatic promotion remains out of scope.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results_cli_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with package-level heldout oracle evaluator
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; heldout oracle result gate is now executable, but not satisfied by real/reviewed rows
- Evidence: `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results.py`; `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.build_heldout_oracle_results`; `tests/test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py`
- Product surface changed: additive diagnostic CLI that reads deterministic `heldout_oracle_manifest.tsv` plus observed boundary/area result rows and writes `heldout_oracle_results.tsv` with source artifact SHA. It does not run RAW, generate reviewed oracle rows, mutate matrices, or authorize non-standard peaks.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py::test_standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results_cli_writes_contract_tsv tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py::test_standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results_classify_boundary_and_area -q`; touched-file ruff passed
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready still needed
  real/reviewed heldout oracle rows and a bounded 85RAW expected-diff gate.
  Later `standard_peak_heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_v1` supplies a
  high-signal clean heldout slice; broad activation still needs scope/expected
  diff acceptance.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_seed_guard_realdata_85raw_artifact_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with synthetic/focused coverage and executable heldout-oracle CLI
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; real-data artifact evidence now covers seed guard/write attribution on one existing 85RAW chunk without rerunning RAW
- Evidence: `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/r1_120_no_raw_productization/standard_peak_backfill_productization_summary.json`; `standard_peak_activation_inputs/seed_guard_decisions.tsv`; `activated_matrix/activation_value_delta.tsv`
- Product surface changed: none beyond the existing explicit productization bridge. The run reused `output/standard_peak_backfill_preset_85raw_20260610/alignment_preset_dna_dr_85raw_validation_minimal` pre-backfill matrix, identity, review, and chunk `r1_120` shadow projection; it did not open RAW files, rewrite workbook schema, or enable non-standard promotion.
- Validation: `uv run python -m tools.diagnostics.standard_peak_backfill_productization ... --source-run-id seed-guard-realdata-85raw-r1-120-20260617`; status `pass`; 2540 seed-guard candidate rows; 1160 `eligible_continue_existing_gates` rows; 1380 `blocked_low_seed_support` rows; `activation_value_delta.tsv` has 1160 rows and summary reports `matrix_cells_written=1160`.
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready still needed
  real/reviewed heldout oracle rows and a bounded expected-diff acceptance that
  explicitly approves the 85RAW product value changes. Later high-signal clean
  heldout trace evidence narrows, but does not remove, the broad activation
  scope blocker.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_seed_guard_realdata_85raw_consolidated_no_raw_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with synthetic/focused coverage and one existing 85RAW chunk no-RAW bridge
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; real-data artifact evidence now covers seed guard/write attribution on the existing 85RAW consolidated shadow projection without rerunning RAW
- Evidence: `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/consolidated_no_raw_productization/standard_peak_backfill_productization_summary.json`; `standard_peak_activation_inputs/seed_guard_decisions.tsv`; `activated_matrix/activation_value_delta.tsv`
- Product surface changed: none beyond the existing explicit productization bridge. The run reused `output/standard_peak_backfill_preset_85raw_20260610/alignment_preset_dna_dr_85raw_validation_minimal/standard_peak_backfill_preset/consolidated/consolidated_shadow_projection_cells.tsv` plus pre-standard-backfill matrix/identity inputs; it did not open RAW files, rewrite workbook schema, or enable non-standard promotion.
- Validation: `uv run python -m tools.diagnostics.standard_peak_backfill_productization ... --source-run-id seed-guard-realdata-85raw-consolidated-20260617`; elapsed about 6.93 s; status `pass`; 7307 seed-guard candidate rows; 4613 `eligible_continue_existing_gates` rows; 2694 `blocked_low_seed_support` rows; `activation_value_delta.tsv` has 4613 rows and summary reports `matrix_cells_written=4613`; `write_authority_status` counts are 4613 `cohort_scale_standard_backfill` and 2694 `no_write`, with zero `blocked_unattributed_write`. Subagent reviewer `Popper` found no blocking issue and confirmed the docs keep this as `production_candidate` evidence, not `production_ready` or reviewed-oracle evidence.
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready still needed
  real/reviewed heldout oracle rows and a bounded expected-diff acceptance that
  explicitly approves the 85RAW product value changes. Later high-signal clean
  heldout trace evidence narrows, but does not remove, the broad activation
  scope blocker.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_heldout_oracle_source_audit_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with no-RAW 85RAW consolidated evidence
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; `production_ready` checkpoint is explicitly blocked on independent observed boundary evidence
- Evidence: `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_oracle_source_audit/summary.json`; `raw85_manual_verdict_seed_guard_crosswalk.tsv`; source manual verdicts under `output/backfill_peakhypothesis_promotion_8raw_20260608/raw85_hypothesis_manual_review_top14_user_standard/`
- Product surface changed: none. This is a source audit only; it did not open RAW, generate heldout oracle manifest/results, mutate matrices, or promote non-standard peaks.
- Validation: no existing `heldout_oracle_manifest.tsv`, observed oracle TSV, or `heldout_oracle_results.tsv` was found under `output/`. The audit reviewed 11 raw85 manual verdict rows and 11 matching review-queue rows: all 11 have oracle boundary/area source values, but only 2 match current consolidated seed-guard candidate keys; those 2 have observed area through `activation_value_delta.tsv` but lack an independent observed start/end boundary artifact. The remaining 9 rows do not match the current seed-guard candidate keys.
- Remaining blocker: provide or generate `observed_start_rt`, `observed_end_rt`, and `observed_area` for matched reviewed cases from an independent implementation result source; the observed-result provenance contract is defined in the following log entry and must be satisfied before the oracle gate can count for production readiness.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_heldout_oracle_observed_provenance_contract_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with no-RAW 85RAW consolidated evidence and source-audit blocker
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; observed-result contract gap is closed.
  At this checkpoint no reviewed observed rows had been generated yet; later
  `standard_peak_heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_v1` supplies a high-signal
  clean independent reintegration slice.
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs`; `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results.py`; `tests/test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py`; `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-backfill-integration-policy-spec.md`
- Product surface changed: `heldout_observed_results.tsv` now requires observed provenance columns: `observed_result_source`, `observed_boundary_source`, `observed_area_source`, and `observed_independence_basis`. Allowed independence bases are `product_writer_observed_result`, `masked_rerun_observed_result`, and `independent_boundary_reintegration_result`; oracle/manual/review-queue source copies fail closed after source-label canonicalization. `heldout_oracle_results.tsv` now carries those provenance columns forward for auditability, and `result_source_artifact_path` must exist so the output SHA cannot be blank. No RAW, matrix writer, workbook schema, default extraction, or non-standard peak policy changed.
- Validation: red/green focused tests proved missing provenance, oracle/manual/review-queue source-copy variants, and missing result-source artifact rows failed after implementation; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py -k heldout_oracle -q` (`20 passed` at that checkpoint; later `25 passed` after original-cell-status and source-cross-check guards); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` (`37 passed` at that checkpoint; later `42 passed` after the same guards); latest full local gate after the source-cross-check guard also passed: ruff, mypy, `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3698 passed, 1 skipped`), diagnostics index, and `git diff --check` with LF/CRLF warnings only. Subagent reviewer `Gibbs` found the source-label and missing-artifact gaps; both were fixed.
- Remaining blocker: production-ready still needs observed start/end/area rows for reviewed heldout cases from an allowed independent source, plus bounded 85RAW expected-diff approval.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_heldout_original_detected_guard_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with observed-result provenance contract
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; invalid reviewed/rescued rows are now blocked from serving as heldout oracle product-readiness evidence
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs`; `tests/test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py`; `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-13-backfill-integration-policy-spec.md`; exploratory read of existing trace artifacts for `FAM002634 / Breast_Cancer_Tissue_pooled_QC3` and `FAM017068 / Breast_Cancer_Tissue_pooled_QC5`
- Product surface changed: `heldout_oracle_manifest.tsv` now requires `heldout_original_cell_status`. Accepted values are `detected`, `detected_seed`, `quantifiable_detected`, and `accepted_detected`; `rescued` and unknown statuses fail before result evaluation. No RAW, matrix writer, workbook schema, default extraction, or non-standard peak policy changed.
- Validation: red/green focused test `test_standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results_requires_original_detected_cell_status`; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py -k heldout_oracle -q` (`21 passed` at that checkpoint; later `25 passed` after the observed-source cross-check guard); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` (`38 passed` at that checkpoint; later `42 passed` after the observed-source cross-check guard)
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready needed true originally
  detected heldout cases, not the current two matched reviewed rows, plus
  independent observed start/end/area rows and bounded 85RAW expected-diff
  approval. Later high-signal clean heldout trace evidence supplies that slice;
  broad activation still needs scope/expected-diff acceptance.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_heldout_observed_source_crosscheck_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with observed-result provenance and original-cell-status guard
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; the heldout oracle gate is harder to
  spoof. At this checkpoint the valid observed heldout artifact was still
  pending; later `standard_peak_heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_v1` supplies
  a high-signal clean independent reintegration slice.
- Evidence: subagent reviewer `Ptolemy` found that neutral observed source labels could still copy the manifest `oracle_source`; fix landed in `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs` plus tests
- Product surface changed: fail-closed validation only. Observed provenance source labels are still additive TSV inputs, but now each observed row is validated against its matching manifest row and `observed_result_source`, `observed_boundary_source`, or `observed_area_source` cannot canonicalize to the same label as manifest `oracle_source`. Source-label canonicalization also collapses repeated punctuation/whitespace separators. No RAW, matrix writer, workbook schema, default extraction, or non-standard peak policy changed.
- Validation: red/green neutral oracle-source self-copy test; original-cell-status allowlist/blank/unknown coverage; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py -k heldout_oracle -q` (`25 passed`); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` (`42 passed`); touched-file ruff/mypy passed.
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready still needed true
  originally detected heldout cases with independent observed start/end/area
  rows and bounded 85RAW expected-diff approval. Later high-signal clean
  heldout trace evidence supplies that slice; broad activation still needs
  scope/expected-diff acceptance.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_oracle_gate_review_hardening_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard with executable oracle gate and no-RAW 85RAW artifact bridge
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; review blockers were fixed without expanding product authority
- Evidence: subagent reviewer `Peirce` found heldout-oracle manifest schema enforcement gaps, duplicate/extra observed result ambiguity, and missing hard failure for `blocked_unattributed_write`; reviewer `Euclid` found a non-blocking schema-version value hardening gap; reviewer `Noether` found a package-evaluator direct-call required-column hardening gap. Fixes landed in `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results.py`, `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs`, `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_backfill_productization`, and focused tests.
- Product surface changed: fail-closed behavior only. Heldout oracle CLI and package evaluator now require the full spec manifest schema and manifest schema-version value, reject duplicate/stale observed oracle rows, and productization now reports `status=fail` if post-apply seed-guard attribution marks `blocked_unattributed_write`.
- Validation: new red/green tests plus `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` (`27 passed` after tolerance-ceiling and exact-threshold tests); focused ruff/mypy passed; no-RAW 85RAW artifact bridge rerun still `pass` with 1160 writes and zero `blocked_unattributed_write`.
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready still needed
  real/reviewed heldout oracle rows and a bounded expected-diff acceptance that
  explicitly approves the 85RAW product value changes. Later high-signal clean
  heldout trace evidence narrows, but does not remove, the broad activation
  scope blocker.

### 2026-06-17 - product_decision_backfill_oracle_and_nlfail_limited_optin_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard and targeted MS1 shape explicit opt-in
- New tier: unchanged; product decisions accepted, runtime defaults not changed
- Evidence: user accepted Backfill heldout oracle first-gate tolerance of boundary error `<=0.1 min` and area relative error `<=10%`; user also accepted `NL_FAIL/NO_MS2` limited opt-in first scope as `5-hmdC + 5-medC` only, with product output limited to `detected_flagged`
- Product surface changed: docs/control-plane decision only. No default extraction, GUI rescue, matrix writer, workbook schema, or primary matrix behavior changed in this entry.
- Validation: docs-only decision record; prior gates remain `ruff`, `mypy`, full `pytest`, diagnostics index, `git diff --check`, and no-RAW 85RAW bridge.
- Remaining blocker: Backfill still needs real/reviewed heldout oracle rows generated under the accepted tolerance plus bounded 85RAW expected-diff approval. `NL_FAIL` limited opt-in still needs implementation evidence before it can be treated as no-flag default rescue.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_oracle_tolerance_ceiling_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard and executable heldout oracle result gate
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; oracle manifest guard now enforces the accepted first-gate tolerance ceiling
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs`; `tests/test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py`
- Product surface changed: fail-closed gate only. Heldout oracle manifest rows may specify stricter tolerance, but values looser than boundary error `0.1 min` or area relative error `0.10` now raise before result evaluation. No default extraction, matrix writer, workbook schema, or non-standard promotion changed.
- Validation: `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py::test_standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results_rejects_loose_tolerances tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py::test_standard_peak_heldout_oracle_results_accepts_strict_tolerances -q` (`2 passed`); `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` (`25 passed`)
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready still needed
  real/reviewed heldout oracle rows under this ceiling and bounded 85RAW
  expected-diff approval. Later high-signal clean heldout trace evidence
  narrows, but does not remove, the broad activation scope blocker.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_oracle_exact_threshold_float_fix_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for standard-path seed guard and heldout oracle tolerance ceiling
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; subagent review blocker fixed
- Evidence: reviewer `Linnaeus` identified exact-threshold float comparison risk; `xic_extractor.diagnostics.standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs`; `tests/test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py`
- Product surface changed: comparison helper only. Mathematically exact boundary error `0.1 min` and area relative error `0.10` are now accepted despite binary float representation; values meaningfully above the ceiling still fail. No runtime default, matrix writer, workbook schema, or non-standard promotion changed.
- Validation: exact-boundary tests `2 passed`; `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_shadow_activation_inputs.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` (`27 passed`)
- Remaining blocker at this checkpoint: production-ready still needed
  real/reviewed heldout oracle rows under this ceiling and bounded 85RAW
  expected-diff approval. Later high-signal clean heldout trace evidence
  narrows, but does not remove, the broad activation scope blocker.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for broad standard-path seed guard with
  an executable heldout oracle gate but no valid originally detected observed
  rows.
- New tier: still `production_candidate` for broad standard-path activation;
  bounded high-signal clean standard trace heldout oracle evidence now passes.
- Evidence:
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle/summary.json`;
  `heldout_oracle_manifest.tsv`; `heldout_observed_results.tsv`;
  `heldout_oracle_results.tsv`;
  `heldout_trace_reintegration_full_eligible_pool.tsv`; source 85RAW
  validation-minimal trace/evidence artifacts under
  `output/standard_peak_backfill_preset_85raw_20260610/alignment_preset_dna_dr_85raw_validation_minimal/`.
- Product surface changed: none. The artifact reuses existing stored 85RAW trace
  arrays and existing package helpers (`find_peak_and_area` with
  `resolver_mode=local_minimum`, `integration_from_peak_trace` with AsLS /
  gaussian15 morphology area). It does not open RAW, mutate matrices, rewrite
  workbook schema, enable default rescue, or authorize non-standard promotion.
- Validation: deterministic selection produced 20 originally detected,
  sample-local, high-signal clean standard trace cases across 20 families
  (`cell_height>=2e6`, width 0.30-0.65 min, shape similarity >=0.95,
  local/global max ratio >=0.95, apex within 0.15 min of family center, at
  least 10 scans, one case per family). The formal heldout oracle CLI wrote
  20 rows; all 20 have `oracle_case_status=pass` and
  `included_in_product_acceptance=TRUE`. Maximum boundary error is 0.0820502
  min and maximum area relative error is 0.0762325, inside the accepted
  `0.1 min / 10% area` ceiling. The full eligible pool artifact persists all
  80 pre-observed eligible rows with quality rank, selected flag, and rejection
  reason; unselected rows do not carry observed reintegration outcomes.
- Remaining blocker: this evidence supports only the high-signal clean standard
  trace slice. The existing consolidated productization bridge still emits
  4613 eligible activation writes and is not scoped by those high-signal clean
  eligibility thresholds. To claim broad `production_ready`, either narrow the
  activation contract to this eligible scope and run an expected-diff
  acceptance, or generate a broader masked/product-writer observed oracle that
  covers the full activation scope.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_activation_scope_audit_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for broad standard-path seed guard with
  passing high-signal clean heldout trace oracle, but no quantified bridge from
  that oracle envelope to the actual consolidated activation writes.
- New tier: still `production_candidate` for broad 4613-row standard-path
  activation; explicit high-signal clean scoped activation is now a bounded
  product-decision candidate, not an implicit broad ready claim.
- Evidence:
  `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py`;
  `xic_extractor/diagnostics/standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py`;
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/high_signal_clean_activation_scope_audit/activation_high_signal_clean_scope_summary.json`;
  `activation_high_signal_clean_scope_audit.tsv`;
  `eligible_activation_value_delta.tsv`.
- Product surface changed: none. The audit reads existing
  `activation_value_delta.tsv`, consolidated
  `consolidated_shadow_projection_cells.tsv`, and sibling
  `*_trace_data.json` artifacts. It does not open RAW, mutate matrices, rewrite
  workbooks, change default extraction, or enable non-standard promotion.
- Validation: focused TDD test
  `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py -q`
  passed. The real no-RAW audit found 4613 written activation rows, all joined
  to projection rows; 3526 joined to trace JSON, 1087 had missing overlay path,
  72 were high-signal clean eligible, 3454 were trace-matched but outside the
  high-signal clean envelope, and broad scope status is `not_ready`.
- Remaining blocker: choosing the first release product scope. To claim
  `production_ready`, either make the activation contract explicitly write only
  the 72 high-signal-clean eligible rows and run expected-diff acceptance, or
  produce a broader masked/product-writer observed oracle for the full 4613-row
  activation scope.
- Next checkpoint: ask the product-scope decision before changing matrix-writing
  behavior; do not silently convert the 4613-row broad bridge into a 72-row
  product output.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_narrow_expected_diff_acceptance_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for broad standard-path seed guard;
  high-signal-clean 72-row subset was quantified but did not yet have a
  delta-level expected-diff acceptance gate.
- New tier: still `production_candidate` for broad 4613-row standard-path
  activation. The 72-row high-signal-clean subset now has passing narrow
  expected-diff acceptance, but it is not product output until a writer contract
  explicitly limits activation to that scope.
- Evidence:
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/high_signal_clean_activation_scope_audit/narrow_activation_expected_diff_acceptance.json`;
  `narrow_activation_expected_diff_acceptance.tsv`;
  `eligible_activation_value_delta.tsv`.
- Product surface changed: none. The gate reads existing activation delta,
  scope audit, and filtered eligible delta. It writes only diagnostic acceptance
  artifacts and records `product_surface_changed=FALSE`.
- Validation: focused tests
  `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py -q` now
  pass 5 tests, including provenance-SHA join and fail-closed non-eligible
  delta coverage. Real no-RAW acceptance on the 85RAW consolidated artifact
  reports `acceptance_status=pass`, `full_written_delta_row_count=4613`,
  `eligible_audit_row_count=72`, `eligible_delta_row_count=72`,
  `duplicate_delta_key_count=0`, `missing_delta_row_count=0`,
  `unexpected_delta_row_count=0`, `non_eligible_delta_row_count=0`,
  `not_written_delta_row_count=0`, `unchanged_delta_row_count=0`, and
  `blank_activated_value_count=0`. Closeout gates also passed:
  `uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests tools scripts`,
  `uv run mypy xic_extractor` (`343 source files`),
  `uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3704 passed, 1 skipped`),
  `uv run python scripts\check_diagnostics_index.py` (`87 entry points, 166
  total files`), and `git diff --check` with only LF/CRLF warnings.
- Remaining blocker: product-scope decision and writer contract. If the first
  release uses the 72-row scope, the writer must be explicitly narrowed and
  gated before any formal matrix output is produced. If the release uses broad
  4613-row scope, this acceptance is insufficient and a broader oracle is still
  required.
- Next checkpoint: choose narrow writer contract versus broad oracle. Do not
  rerun RAW unless it will decide that checkpoint.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_narrow_product_writer_v1

- Previous tier: 72-row high-signal-clean Backfill subset had passing
  delta-level expected-diff acceptance, but no product writer was limited to
  that scope. Broad 4613-row standard-path activation remained
  `production_candidate`.
- New tier: `production_ready` for the explicit 72-row high-signal-clean scoped
  writer; broad 4613-row standard-path activation remains
  `production_candidate`.
- Evidence:
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/narrow_high_signal_clean_no_raw_productization/standard_peak_backfill_productization_summary.json`;
  `narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json`;
  `activated_matrix/activation_value_delta.tsv`.
- Product surface changed: additive opt-in CLI surface
  `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py --high-signal-clean-activation-scope-audit-tsv`.
  It filters productization input to audit rows with
  `high_signal_clean_status=eligible`, then writes the existing matrix-only
  activated-matrix output under the task output directory. It does not change
  default extraction, workbook schema, GUI behavior, non-standard promotion, or
  the broad activation bridge. The additive summary fields bump the
  productization summary schema to `standard_peak_backfill_productization_v1`;
  reviewer `Mill` found the missing schema bump as P2, and the fix was verified
  with a focused schema assertion plus a rerun of the narrow no-RAW artifact.
- Validation: focused tests
  `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passed 10 tests at implementation checkpoint. Touched-file ruff and mypy
  passed. The real no-RAW 85RAW consolidated artifact run selected 72 eligible
  shadow rows, wrote 72 matrix cells and 72 activation-delta rows, and
  `narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json` reports
  `acceptance_status=pass`, `readiness_tier=production_ready`,
  `eligible_audit_row_count=72`, `product_written_delta_row_count=72`,
  `duplicate_delta_key_count=0`, `missing_delta_row_count=0`,
  `unexpected_delta_row_count=0`, `non_eligible_delta_row_count=0`,
  `not_written_delta_row_count=0`, `unchanged_delta_row_count=0`, and
  `blank_activated_value_count=0`.
- Remaining blocker: none for the 72-row narrow release slice. Broad 4613-row
  activation still needs broader masked/product-writer observed oracle evidence
  before it can claim `production_ready`.
- Next checkpoint: preserve the 72-row scope as an explicit release claim; do
  not broaden the writer without a new expected-diff/oracle packet.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_scan_trace_oracle_v1

- Previous tier: broad 4613-row Backfill activation remained
  `production_candidate`; 72-row high-signal clean scoped writer was
  `production_ready`.
- New tier: still `production_candidate` for broad activation; low-scan clean
  trace evidence now has a passing held-out oracle packet.
- Evidence:
  `xic_extractor/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py`;
  `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py`;
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_low_scan_clean_probe/summary.json`;
  `heldout_oracle_results.tsv`.
- Product surface changed: additive diagnostic CLI that builds reproducible
  held-out trace oracle packets from existing detected cell evidence and stored
  trace JSON. It does not open RAW, mutate matrices, change workbook schema,
  authorize non-standard peaks, or broaden the Backfill writer by itself.
- Validation: focused test
  `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q`
  passed. The real no-RAW 85RAW low-scan run found 56 eligible candidates
  across 11 families, selected 11 cases, and `heldout_oracle_results.tsv`
  reports 11/11 `pass`, 11/11 `included_in_product_acceptance=TRUE`, max
  boundary error `4.86717e-05` min, and max area relative error `0.038786`
  under the accepted `0.1 min / 10% area` ceiling.
- Remaining blocker: this oracle only supports the explicit low-scan clean
  trace class; a writer scope and expected-diff packet are still required
  before product claims.
- Next checkpoint: connect low-scan clean eligibility to activation scope audit
  and a scoped product writer.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_scan_scoped_writer_v1

- Previous tier: low-scan clean Backfill trace class had a passing held-out
  oracle but no product writer limited to that scope.
- New tier: `production_ready` for the explicit 42-row low-scan-clean scoped
  writer; broad 4613-row standard-path activation remains
  `production_candidate`.
- Evidence:
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/high_signal_clean_activation_scope_audit/activation_high_signal_clean_scope_summary.json`;
  `low_scan_clean_activation_expected_diff_acceptance.json`;
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/narrow_low_scan_clean_no_raw_productization/standard_peak_backfill_productization_summary.json`;
  `narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json`;
  `activated_matrix/activation_value_delta.tsv`.
- Product surface changed: additive opt-in CLI surface
  `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py --low-scan-clean-activation-scope-audit-tsv`.
  It filters productization input to audit rows with
  `low_scan_clean_status=eligible` and writes the existing matrix-only
  activated-matrix output under the task output directory. Only one scoped
  audit flag may be supplied at a time. No default extraction, workbook schema,
  GUI behavior, non-standard promotion, or broad activation bridge changed.
- Validation: focused tests
  `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q`
  passed 19 tests after fail-closed scope hardening; touched-file ruff/mypy
  passed. The real combined-scope
  audit found 42 low-scan clean eligible writes out of 4613 and
  `low_scan_clean_activation_expected_diff_acceptance.json` reports
  `acceptance_status=pass`, 42/42 eligible rows, and zero duplicate, missing,
  unexpected, non-eligible, non-written, unchanged, or blank-value rows. The
  real no-RAW scoped writer selected 42 shadow rows, wrote 42 matrix cells and
  42 activation-delta rows, and `narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json`
  reports `acceptance_status=pass`, `readiness_tier=production_ready`,
  `expected_scope=low_scan_clean_eligible_activation_rows`, and zero blockers.
- Remaining blocker: none for the explicit 42-row low-scan release slice. The
  old broad-scope expansion language is historical and superseded by the later
  `park_broad_backfill` decision.
- Next checkpoint: superseded. Later low-height, apex-delta, and width-only
  probes all failed closed, and broad auto-write is now parked; do not use this
  entry to justify another scoped writer.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_scan_review_fix_v1

- Previous tier: explicit 42-row low-scan-clean scoped writer was
  `production_ready`, with broad 4613-row standard-path activation still
  `production_candidate`.
- New tier: unchanged; the 42-row low-scan-clean scoped writer remains
  `production_ready`, and broad 4613-row activation remains
  `production_candidate`.
- Evidence: subagent reviewers found no P1/P2 issue. Review feedback identified
  P3 docs drift where the control-plane intro and spec residual-blocker text
  still emphasized only the 72-row high-signal slice. The docs now explicitly
  name both release-ready slices: 72-row high-signal clean and 42-row low-scan
  clean. Focused tests now cover the low-scan scope writer's fail-closed paths:
  multiple scope audit flags, no eligible low-scan rows, duplicate eligible
  audit SHA, audit SHA missing from shadow projection, and duplicate shadow
  projection SHA.
- Product surface changed: none. This is docs/test hardening only; no default
  extraction, workbook schema, GUI behavior, non-standard promotion, matrix
  identity, selected peak, selected area, or broad activation behavior changed.
- Validation: `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q`
  (`19 passed`); `uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests tools scripts`
  (pass); `uv run mypy xic_extractor` (pass, 346 source files);
  `uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3721 passed, 1 skipped`);
  `uv run python scripts\check_diagnostics_index.py`
  (`88 entry points, 167 total files`); `git diff --check` (no whitespace
  errors; Windows LF/CRLF warnings only).
- Remaining blocker: none for the explicit 42-row low-scan release slice. Broad
  4613-row activation still needs additional named evidence classes and
  expected-diff approval before broad `production_ready`.
- Next checkpoint: choose one additional evidence-sufficient class, produce or
  reuse a matching held-out oracle packet, then connect it through activation
  scope audit and scoped writer expected-diff before adding more automatic
  writes.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_height_probe_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier at the time: broad 4613-row standard-path activation was still
  unresolved under the pre-park framing; the next proposed single-blocker class
  was height-only or apex-delta-only.
- New tier at this checkpoint: low-height clean was `production_candidate` only.
  The explicit
  72-row high-signal-clean and 42-row low-scan-clean scoped writers remained
  `production_ready`; the broad-scope statement is superseded by the later
  `park_broad_backfill` decision.
- Evidence:
  `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now accepts
  `--target-shape-class standard_low_height_clean_trace`, where all clean
  thresholds remain in force except cell height must be below `2e6`.
  The no-RAW 85RAW heldout packet under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_low_height_clean_probe/`
  found 230 eligible candidate rows across 54 families and selected 20
  family-representative cases. It failed closed with 19/20 pass and one
  `fail_boundary` case:
  `HOLDOUT85TRACE001_FAM008651_TumorBC2312_DNA`, boundary error
  `1.16445 min`, area relative error about `0.033`.
- Additional audit evidence:
  `standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py` now writes
  `low_height_clean_activation_value_delta.tsv` and
  `low_height_clean_activation_expected_diff_acceptance.tsv/json`. The real
  combined audit found 57 low-height clean eligible writes out of 4613; the
  diagnostic expected-diff packet passed 57/57 with zero duplicate, missing,
  unexpected, non-eligible, non-written, unchanged, or blank rows, and
  `product_surface_changed=FALSE`.
- Product surface changed: no matrix writer was added for low-height; no
  default extraction behavior, workbook schema, GUI behavior, non-standard
  promotion, matrix identity, selected peak, selected area, or broad activation
  behavior changed.
- Review: subagent reviewers `Jason` and `Volta` found no P1/P2 blockers. P3
  docs/index wording and CLI labeling gaps were fixed so low-height is visibly
  diagnostic/candidate-only and not product writer approval.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  (`22 passed`); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests tools scripts`
  (pass); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor` (pass,
  346 source files); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3724 passed, 1 skipped`);
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts\check_diagnostics_index.py`
  (`88 entry points, 167 total files`); `git diff --check` (no whitespace
  errors; Windows LF/CRLF warnings only). The no-RAW heldout oracle command
  exited `1` by design because the summary status is `fail`; the activation
  scope audit rerun exited `0` and emitted the 57-row expected-diff packet
  above.
- Remaining blocker: superseded by
  `standard_peak_low_height_bounded_reintegration_probe_v1` and
  `standard_peak_low_height_scoped_writer_v1`. Low-height later passed a
  bounded-window oracle packet and the explicit 57-row writer expected-diff
  gate.
- Next checkpoint: see `standard_peak_low_height_scoped_writer_v1`; apex-delta
  and width-only were evaluated after this entry and still failed closed.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_apex_delta_probe_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier at the time: broad 4613-row standard-path activation was still
  unresolved under the pre-park framing; apex-delta-only was the next small
  single-blocker class after low-height failed its oracle.
- New tier: apex-delta clean is `production_candidate` only. The explicit
  72-row high-signal-clean and 42-row low-scan-clean scoped writers remained
  `production_ready`; the broad-scope statement is superseded by the later
  `park_broad_backfill` decision.
- Evidence:
  `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now accepts
  `--target-shape-class standard_apex_delta_clean_trace`, where supported trace
  status, shape >=0.95, local/global >=0.95, height >=2e6, width 0.30-0.65 min,
  and at least 10 boundary scans remain required, but apex delta from family
  center must exceed 0.15 min. The no-RAW 85RAW heldout packet under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_apex_delta_clean_probe/`
  found 78 eligible candidate rows across 27 families and selected 20
  family-representative cases. It failed closed with 17/20 pass and three
  `fail_boundary` cases. Max boundary error was `2.19621 min`; max area
  relative error was `0.424518`.
- Product surface changed: no matrix writer was added for apex-delta; no
  activation scope audit columns, default extraction behavior, workbook schema,
  GUI behavior, non-standard promotion, matrix identity, selected peak,
  selected area, or broad activation behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q`
  (`3 passed`); the no-RAW heldout oracle command exited `1` by design because
  the summary status is `fail`.
- Remaining blocker: apex-delta cannot be promoted to `production_ready` until
  a narrower fail-closed evidence rule or a new accepted oracle packet passes
  the `0.1 min / 10% area` gate. Current failures include apex deltas around
  `0.2493` and `0.273`, so a broad threshold-only promotion is not justified.
- Next checkpoint: do not add an apex-delta writer. Width-only was evaluated in
  the following entry and also failed its oracle; remaining single-blocker
  classes should be parked candidate-only unless a stronger evidence model
  exists.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_width_probe_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier at the time: broad 4613-row standard-path activation was still
  unresolved under the pre-park framing; width-only was the smallest remaining
  single-blocker class after low-height and apex-delta failed their oracles.
- New tier: width-only clean is `production_candidate` only. The explicit
  72-row high-signal-clean and 42-row low-scan-clean scoped writers remained
  `production_ready`; the broad-scope statement is superseded by the later
  `park_broad_backfill` decision.
- Evidence:
  `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now accepts
  `--target-shape-class standard_width_clean_trace`, where supported trace
  status, shape >=0.95, local/global >=0.95, height >=2e6, apex delta <=0.15
  min, and at least 10 boundary scans remain required, but boundary width must
  fall outside 0.30-0.65 min. The no-RAW 85RAW heldout packet under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_width_clean_probe/`
  found 4 eligible candidate rows across 3 families and selected 3
  family-representative cases. It failed closed with 1/3 pass, one `fail_area`
  case, and one `fail_boundary` case. Max boundary error was `1.86561 min`;
  max area relative error was `0.599229`.
- Product surface changed: no matrix writer was added for width-only; no
  activation scope audit columns, default extraction behavior, workbook schema,
  GUI behavior, non-standard promotion, matrix identity, selected peak,
  selected area, or broad activation behavior changed.
- Review: subagent reviewer `Ohm` found one P2 test-strength issue: the
  initial width-only test only locked the over-wide happy path and not the
  narrow-width branch, inclusive `0.30` / `0.65` boundaries, or dirty
  shape/local-global/height/apex/scan sentinels. This was fixed with a direct
  selector contract test. Subagent reviewer `Hubble` found no P1/P2
  docs/product-claim blocker.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q`
  (`5 passed`); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests tools scripts`
  (pass); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor` (pass,
  346 source files); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3727 passed, 1 skipped`);
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts\check_diagnostics_index.py`
  (`88 entry points, 167 total files`); `git diff --check` (no whitespace
  errors; Windows LF/CRLF warnings only). The no-RAW heldout oracle command
  exited `1` by design because the summary status is `fail`.
- Remaining blocker: width-only cannot be promoted to `production_ready` until
  a narrower fail-closed evidence rule or a new accepted oracle packet passes
  the `0.1 min / 10% area` gate. Current evidence is too weak for a writer
  because only one of three selected family cases passed.
- Next checkpoint: park low-height, apex-delta, and width-only as
  candidate-only. Do not add writers for these single-blocker classes without a
  stronger evidence model or a new passing oracle packet.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_shape_margin_probe_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier at the time: broad 4613-row standard-path activation was still
  unresolved under the pre-park framing; high-signal and low-scan scoped writers
  were already `production_ready`; low-height, apex-delta, and width-only probes
  were candidate-only after failing heldout oracles.
- New tier: shape-margin clean is `production_candidate` only. The explicit
  72-row high-signal-clean and 42-row low-scan-clean scoped writers remained
  `production_ready`; the broad-scope statement is superseded by the later
  `park_broad_backfill` decision.
- Evidence:
  `tools/diagnostics/standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now accepts
  `--target-shape-class standard_shape_margin_clean_trace`, where supported
  trace status, local/global >=0.95, height >=2e6, boundary width 0.30-0.65
  min, apex delta <=0.15 min, and at least 10 boundary scans remain required,
  but shape similarity is limited to the near-threshold band
  `0.93 <= shape < 0.95`. The no-RAW 85RAW heldout packet under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_shape_margin_clean_probe/`
  found 18 eligible candidate rows across 8 families and selected 8
  family-representative cases. It failed closed with 6/8 pass and two
  `fail_area` cases. Max boundary error was `0.0625542 min`; max area relative
  error was `0.198393`.
- Product surface changed: no matrix writer was added for shape-margin; no
  activation scope audit columns, default extraction behavior, workbook schema,
  GUI behavior, non-standard promotion, matrix identity, selected peak,
  selected area, or broad activation behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q`
  (`7 passed`); focused ruff for the oracle module and test passed. Subagent
  reviewers `Herschel` and `Kuhn` found no P1/P2 blockers. Their P3 findings
  were fixed by adding the shape-margin upper-width exclusion test and aligning
  docs to the summary JSON max area value. The no-RAW heldout oracle command
  exited `1` by design because the summary status is `fail`. Full local gate
  passed: `ruff check xic_extractor tests tools scripts`, `mypy
  xic_extractor`, `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3730 passed, 1 skipped`),
  diagnostics index, and `git diff --check`.
- Remaining blocker: shape-margin cannot be promoted to `production_ready`
  until a narrower fail-closed evidence rule or a new accepted oracle packet
  passes the `0.1 min / 10% area` gate. The failures do not reduce to a simple
  shape-threshold tweak because one failed case had shape `0.949526`.
- Next checkpoint: do not add a shape-margin writer. Continue broadening only
  with another named evidence class that can pass heldout oracle and
  expected-diff writer acceptance.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_limited_policy_gate_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for explicit support-TSV workflow only; limited opt-in policy was accepted by user but still missing implementation gate
- New tier: `production_candidate` for explicit/limited opt-in support-TSV workflow; no-flag default rescue remains off
- Evidence: `targeted_ms1_shape_identity_activation_policy`; CLI flag `--targeted-ms1-shape-identity-activation-policy`; `xic_extractor.targeted_ms1_shape_identity_policy`; `xic_extractor.diagnostics.targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff`; `tools/diagnostics/targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py`; existing 85RAW gate summary `output/ms1_shape_identity_generic_support_85raw_20260616/limited_default_expected_diff_gate_summary.tsv`
- Product surface changed: additive settings key, additive CLI override, manifest provenance field, and additive expected-diff gate. Replay mode rejects the new runtime override. Default settings stay `explicit_support_tsv`; no GUI, workbook schema, selected-candidate switch, manual boundary, or default automatic support producer changed.
- Safe behavior boundary: limited policy accepts supported rows only for `5-hmdC` and `5-medC`; expected-diff gate requires analyte `NL_FAIL` rows to move from `not_counted/FALSE` to `detected_flagged/TRUE` with `own_max_same_peak_support`; matrix diffs are limited to those target measurement columns and must have the same sample/target key set as the long-row diff.
- Validation: `uv run pytest tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py tests\test_extractor_run.py::test_run_limited_shape_identity_policy_without_support_tsv_keeps_output -q` (`7 passed`); existing 85RAW generic artifact gate rerun `pass` with 11 long-row changes and 66 matrix cells; checkpoint full local gate `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3693 passed, 1 skipped`), diagnostics index, and `git diff --check` passed. Latest repo full gate after the later Backfill source-cross-check guard is recorded above.
- Remaining blocker: production-ready/default behavior still needs a separate decision and evidence to auto-build or auto-consume supports during normal extraction; GUI remains out of scope; broader targets need their own expected-diff evidence.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_keyset_gate_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` for explicit/limited opt-in support-TSV workflow.
- New tier: `production_ready` for the headless explicit limited support-TSV workflow only; unflagged normal-extraction rescue remained `blocked` at this checkpoint.
- Evidence: `tools/diagnostics/targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py` now requires `--support-tsv`; `xic_extractor.diagnostics.targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff` validates that accepted support TSV sample/target keys exactly match the long-row expected diff; the existing 85RAW generic support artifact still gates at 11 long rows and 66 matrix cells, with 11 supported support-TSV rows and target counts `5-hmdC=10;5-medC=1`.
- Product surface changed: additive CLI gate input and additive summary metrics (`support_tsv_supported_rows`, `support_tsv_target_counts`). No default settings, normal extraction behavior, GUI, workbook schema, selected candidate, area recompute, or target scope changed.
- Validation: `uv run pytest tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py -q` (`9 passed` after the later support-required hardening); no-RAW 85RAW artifact gate rerun with `--support-tsv output\ms1_shape_identity_generic_support_85raw_20260616\targeted_ms1_shape_identity_v0.tsv`, status `pass`, `long_changed_rows=11`, `matrix_changed_cells=66`, `support_tsv_supported_rows=11`; latest full local gate after support-required hardening passed with `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3707 passed, 1 skipped`), diagnostics index, and `git diff --check`.
- Remaining blocker: unflagged normal-extraction rescue still needed a separate activation/call-cost/product contract before support generation could run without an explicit auto/support flag. Broader targets beyond `5-hmdC + 5-medC` need separate expected-diff evidence.
- Next checkpoint: keep release wording to "headless explicit limited support-TSV workflow" for this entry; do not call no-flag default extraction, GUI, or broader target rescue production-ready.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_default_rescue_blocker_audit_v1

- Previous tier: `blocked` for unflagged default `NL_FAIL` rescue; `production_ready` only for the headless explicit limited support-TSV workflow.
- New tier: still `blocked` for unflagged default rescue at this checkpoint; explicit limited support-TSV workflow remains `production_ready`.
- Evidence: user accepted the limited default product direction (`5-hmdC + 5-medC`, `detected_flagged` only), but at this checkpoint the implementation had no automatic support producer or default support input contract. Normal extraction consumed `targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_tsv` only when explicitly configured, and default settings remained `explicit_support_tsv` with an empty support TSV. A later entry adds an explicit headless auto CLI, but no-flag default behavior remains separate.
- Product surface changed: docs/control-plane wording only. No default settings, normal extraction behavior, GUI, workbook schema, matrix identity, counted detection, selected candidate, or manual boundary behavior changed.
- Validation: focused gates rerun after the audit: `uv run pytest tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py -q` (`9 passed` after the later support-required hardening); `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` (`5 passed`); `uv run pytest tests\test_provisional_backfill_candidate_gate_cli.py -q` (`8 passed`); `uv run pytest tests\test_settings_new_fields.py tests\test_extractor_run.py::test_run_applies_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_tsv tests\test_extractor_run.py::test_run_limited_shape_identity_policy_without_support_tsv_keeps_output tests\test_run_extraction.py::test_cli_passes_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_override tests\test_run_extraction.py::test_cli_passes_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_activation_policy_override tests\test_run_extraction.py::test_cli_replay_rejects_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_override tests\test_run_extraction.py::test_cli_replay_rejects_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_activation_policy_override tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_projection.py -q` (`18 passed`); existing 85RAW generic support expected-diff gate rerun with `--support-tsv` still `pass`, 11 long rows, 66 matrix cells, 11 supported support rows.
- Remaining blocker: to promote no-flag default rescue, implement and review an activation/call-cost/default-UX contract for automatically producing or selecting support rows during normal extraction, then provide expected-diff evidence for that default path. Do not promote by merely changing the default activation policy.
- Next checkpoint: design no-flag default activation only if it can be bounded by foreground RAW cost, expected-diff evidence, and a user-readable activation packet.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_tsv_required_gate_review_fix_v1

- Previous tier: `production_ready` for the headless explicit limited support-TSV workflow, but subagent reviewer `Cicero` found the CLI/package gate still allowed an output-only pass when `--support-tsv` was omitted.
- New tier: still `production_ready` for the same narrow workflow after fail-closed gate hardening; unflagged normal-extraction rescue remained `blocked` at this checkpoint.
- Evidence: `tools/diagnostics/targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py --support-tsv` is now required; `xic_extractor.diagnostics.targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff` raises when support rows are missing, so the release gate cannot pass without proving support TSV key-set equality.
- Product surface changed: diagnostic gate contract tightened. No default settings, normal extraction behavior, GUI, workbook schema, matrix identity, counted detection, selected candidate, or manual boundary behavior changed.
- Validation: focused tests added for missing support rows and missing CLI `--support-tsv`; `uv run pytest tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py -q` (`9 passed`); focused `ruff` and `mypy` passed; existing 85RAW generic support expected-diff gate rerun with required `--support-tsv` still `pass`; full local gate passed with `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3707 passed, 1 skipped`), diagnostics index, and `git diff --check`.
- Remaining blocker: none for the explicit limited release gate. Unflagged normal-extraction rescue still needed a separate activation/call-cost/default-support contract at this checkpoint.
- Next checkpoint: keep any future output-only diff check under a separate `diagnostic_only` name if it is ever needed; do not share the production-ready gate pass wording.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_tsv_required_spec_drift_fix_v1

- Previous tier: `production_ready` for the headless explicit limited support-TSV workflow after support-required gate hardening.
- New tier: unchanged; no product tier movement.
- Evidence: subagent reviewer `Dirac` found one P3 docs drift in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-16-shared-target-untarget-peak-identity-spine-spec.md` where the gate still used old output-only support-gate wording.
- Product surface changed: docs wording only; the spec now says the gate requires the actual support TSV.
- Validation: `uv run pytest tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py -q` (`9 passed`); support-optional wording grep no longer finds Targeted MS1 support-TSV contract drift; `git diff --check` has only LF/CRLF warnings.
- Remaining blocker: none for this docs drift. Unflagged normal-extraction rescue remained blocked separately at this checkpoint.
- Next checkpoint: commit this checkpoint after staging only the reviewed 9-file productization diff.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_auto_limited_cli_v1

- Previous tier: `blocked` for automatic `NL_FAIL/NO_MS2` rescue beyond explicit support TSV; `production_ready` only for headless explicit limited support-TSV workflow.
- New tier: `production_ready` for the headless auto-limited CLI workflow; at
  that checkpoint unflagged normal extraction and GUI rescue remained off.
- Evidence: new CLI flag `--targeted-ms1-shape-identity-auto-limited-default`; package support producer `xic_extractor.diagnostics.targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_producer`; auto diff/gate helper `xic_extractor.diagnostics.targeted_ms1_shape_identity_auto_diff`; 8RAW auto smoke at `output/ms1_shape_identity_auto_limited_8raw_20260617/`; 85RAW auto smoke at `output/ms1_shape_identity_auto_limited_85raw_20260617/`; existing 85RAW no-RAW gate mirror at `output/ms1_shape_identity_auto_limited_existing_85raw_gate_20260617/`.
- Product surface changed: additive CLI flag and additive auto output artifact layout (`baseline/output`, `support/targeted_ms1_shape_identity_v0.tsv`, `final_unverified/output` staging before the gate, `final/output` only after the expected-diff gate passes, expected-diff summaries). At that checkpoint, default settings, no-flag extraction behavior, GUI, workbook schema, selected candidate, manual boundary, and broader target scope did not change.
- Safe behavior boundary: auto workflow always builds support only for `5-hmdC + 5-medC`, applies `limited_5hmdc_5medc_v1`, and fails closed through the same support-TSV key-set expected-diff gate. Accepted changes remain `not_counted/FALSE` to `detected_flagged/TRUE`; clean `detected` is not allowed.
- Validation: focused lint passed for changed files; focused tests passed (`tests/test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_auto_diff.py`, support builder, projection, expected-diff gate, and new CLI auto tests; latest focused command reported `29 passed`). 8RAW auto real run passed with `1` support row, `1` long-row change, `6` matrix cells. Existing 85RAW artifact no-RAW auto diff gate passed with `11`/`66`. One foreground 85RAW auto run passed with `11` support rows, `11` long-row changes, `66` matrix cells, diagnostics SHA256 unchanged between baseline/final, and wall-clock `369.2 s`.
- Remaining blocker: none for headless limited auto CLI. At this checkpoint,
  broader targets still needed their own evidence, and making auto rescue run
  when the user provides no flag remained a separate product/default UX
  decision. The later `targeted_ms1_shape_identity_no_flag_default_v1` entry
  records that default decision and guard. GUI remains out of scope.
- Next checkpoint: after subagent review and full local gate, commit this slice. Do not rerun 85RAW again for this lane unless support production/projection/matrix semantics change.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_auto_limited_review_fix_v1

- Previous tier: `production_ready` for headless auto-limited CLI, pending
  subagent review fixes.
- New tier: unchanged; review blockers fixed.
- Evidence: subagent reviewers found stale handoff wording and a CLI
  fail-closed gap where support/gate failures could traceback and leave
  product-shaped `final/output` CSVs before the expected-diff gate passed.
- Product surface changed: fail-closed CLI behavior only. The auto workflow now
  writes the second extraction to `final_unverified/output`, runs the support
  TSV expected-diff gate there, publishes to `final/output` only after pass, and
  writes the final method manifest after publish. Support/gate/schema failures
  return CLI exit code `2` with a concise stderr message and do not publish
  verified final output.
- Validation: focused auto CLI tests now include gate-failure clean error and
  unpublished-final assertions; targeted auto/support focused suite reports
  `30 passed`. Full local gate is recorded in the handoff after this entry.
- Remaining blocker: none for explicit headless auto-limited CLI. No-flag
  default extraction, GUI, and broader target rescue remain separate decisions.
- Next checkpoint: commit after final subagent acceptance and full local gate.

### 2026-06-17 - targeted_ms1_shape_identity_no_flag_default_v1

- Previous tier: `production_ready` for headless explicit support-TSV workflow
  and explicit auto-limited CLI; no-flag normal extraction remained blocked.
- New tier: `production_ready` for canonical no-flag headless normal CLI
  default, limited to `limited_5hmdc_5medc_v1`, `5-hmdC + 5-medC`, and
  `detected_flagged` product output. GUI and broader targets remain out of
  scope.
- Evidence: canonical settings defaults, `config/settings.example.csv`, and
  `CANONICAL_SETTINGS_DEFAULTS` now default
  `targeted_ms1_shape_identity_activation_policy` to
  `limited_5hmdc_5medc_v1`. `scripts/run_extraction.py` dispatches the same
  auto workflow when the effective config has this policy and no
  `targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_tsv`; explicit support TSV or
  `explicit_support_tsv` keeps the old manual/normal path. The no-RAW 85RAW
  existing auto artifact gate was rerun at
  `output/ms1_shape_identity_default_no_flag_existing_85raw_gate_20260617/limited_default_expected_diff_gate_summary.tsv`
  and passed with `long_changed_rows=11`, `matrix_changed_cells=66`,
  `support_tsv_supported_rows=11`, `target_counts=5-hmdC=10;5-medC=1`, and
  `matrix_target_counts=5-hmdC=60;5-medC=6`.
- Product surface changed: canonical settings default and config/example
  default changed; no new workbook schema, GUI behavior, selected candidate,
  manual boundary, target scope, or expected-diff semantics changed. The
  default still publishes final output only after the support TSV key-set
  expected-diff gate passes.
- Validation: focused no-flag/default shard
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_settings_new_fields.py tests\test_settings_section.py tests\test_run_extraction.py tests\test_extractor_run.py::test_run_applies_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_support_tsv tests\test_extractor_run.py::test_run_limited_shape_identity_policy_without_support_tsv_keeps_output tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_projection.py tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_expected_diff_gate.py tests\test_targeted_ms1_shape_identity_auto_diff.py -q`
  passed `65` tests after review fixes. Focused ruff for changed code/tests
  passed. Subagent reviewers `Kant` and `Socrates` found that manual
  `--targeted-ms1-shape-identity-support-tsv` could inherit the limited default
  instead of preserving the explicit path, and that docs still had stale
  no-flag blocked wording. Both findings were fixed before commit. Full local
  gate passed: `ruff check xic_extractor tests tools scripts`, `mypy
  xic_extractor`, `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3728 passed, 1 skipped`), and
  `python scripts\check_diagnostics_index.py`.
- Remaining blocker: none for headless no-flag limited default after final
  review/gate. GUI rescue and any target beyond `5-hmdC + 5-medC` still need
  separate expected-diff evidence and UX/product contract.
- Next checkpoint: historical. Targeted MS1 may broaden only with separate
  evidence for more targets. The Backfill broadening clause is superseded by
  `park_broad_backfill` and must not be used as a current next step.

### 2026-06-17 - backfill_production_gate_research_input_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged. Explicit 72-row high-signal-clean and 42-row
  low-scan-clean scoped writers remain `production_ready`; broad 4613-row
  standard-path activation plus low-height/apex-delta/width-only/shape-margin
  probes remain `production_candidate`.
- New tier: unchanged; this is design input and product-gate framing, not a
  behavior promotion.
- Evidence: reviewed
  `docs/deepresearch/Backfill Production Gate.md`. The conclusion is that
  absolute `height >= 2e6` should not become a universal Backfill product hard
  gate because LC-MS height depends on analyte response, matrix effect, batch
  state, local background, and co-elution. The low-height heldout result
  `19/20 pass + 1 boundary fail` points to boundary/reintegration consistency,
  not a proof that low-height cells are globally unusable.
- Product surface changed: docs/control-plane/handoff only. No writer, matrix,
  schema, CLI flag, workbook, RAW artifact, or expected-diff output changed.
- Validation: docs-only targeted grep and `git diff --check` for this refresh.
- Remaining blocker: no new low-height or moderate-height writer may be added
  just because expected-diff is clean. This entry is now background for future
  truth/review/evidence design, not a writer prompt.
- Next checkpoint: superseded by the later park decision. Future work should
  predeclare truth/review/evidence assets before any new writer authority is
  considered.

### 2026-06-17 - product_direction_low_manual_intervention_v1

- Previous tier at the time: unchanged. Backfill narrow 72-row writer was
  `production_ready`; broad 4613-row standard-path activation was still
  unresolved under the pre-park framing; headless Targeted MS1 auto-limited CLI
  was `production_ready`; ReviewAction selected-candidate/manual-boundary apply
  remained parked for this release claim.
- New tier: unchanged; this entry records product direction, not a new behavior
  promotion.
- Evidence: user decision on 2026-06-17: Backfill north star is to fill whenever
  evidence is sufficient, with the 72-row writer as a demonstrator rather than
  a permanent scope cap; `NL_FAIL` limited rescue should move toward automatic
  low-manual operation, initially `5-hmdC + 5-medC` and `detected_flagged`
  only; ReviewAction/reintegration should eventually minimize manual review,
  with the system responsible for alertness and auditability while the user
  reviews only a small number of obvious/representative cases.
- Product surface changed: docs/control-plane wording only. The later
  `targeted_ms1_shape_identity_no_flag_default_v1` entry changes headless
  no-flag CLI default behavior under the bounded `limited_5hmdc_5medc_v1`
  contract; this direction entry itself does not change GUI wiring, workbook
  schema, matrix schema, selected-candidate switch, manual boundary area
  recompute, or broad Backfill write scope.
- Remaining blocker: broad Backfill still needs broader masked/product-writer
  oracle and expected-diff evidence for any added writes beyond the current
  scoped ready slices. Headless no-flag `NL_FAIL` limited rescue is now covered
  by `targeted_ms1_shape_identity_no_flag_default_v1`; GUI rescue and targets
  beyond `5-hmdC + 5-medC` still need separate expected-diff evidence and UX
  contract. ReviewAction mutation still needs stable IDs, sidecar contracts,
  expected-diff approval, and audited apply output before it can write selected
  peak/area/counting changes.
- Next checkpoint: prioritize bounded automation packets that reduce manual
  review without broad silent writes: broaden Backfill evidence by evidence
  class, extend Targeted MS1 only after separate evidence for more targets, and
  reopen ReviewAction mutation only after the ID/expected-diff contract is
  concrete.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_height_bounded_reintegration_probe_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: low-height clean Backfill slice was `production_candidate`.
  Activation scope audit had 57 eligible low-height writes and diagnostic
  expected-diff 57/57 pass, but full-trace heldout oracle failed 19/20 because
  `FAM008651/TumorBC2312_DNA` had boundary drift over the accepted `0.1 min`
  ceiling.
- New tier: still `production_candidate`; evidence improved, but no writer
  approval and no `production_ready` claim.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now supports diagnostic
  `--observed-reintegration-mode expected_window_bounded` with
  `--expected-window-padding-min`. Default observed reintegration remains
  `full_trace`, so existing oracle behavior is preserved unless the new mode is
  explicit. Existing 85RAW trace artifacts were reused; no RAW files were
  reopened. Low-height bounded replay at `padding=0.1/0.2/0.3 min` still failed
  19/20 because `FAM000883/NormalBC2292_DNA` exceeded the 10% area ceiling, but
  `padding=0.5 min` passed 20/20 with max boundary error `0.0857986 min` and
  max area relative error `0.0564106`.
- Product surface changed: diagnostic CLI and summary fields only:
  `observed_reintegration_mode` and `expected_window_padding_min`. No product
  writer, primary matrix, workbook schema, selected peak/area, counted
  detection, extraction default, or RAW artifact changed.
- Validation: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest
  tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q` passed `10`. Subagent
  reviewer `Tesla` found no blocking issue and no product overclaim; its P3
  stale-handoff wording and edge-test findings were fixed by clarifying that
  bounded oracle pass does not authorize a writer, adding CLI negative-padding
  coverage, and adding a bounded-mode missing-observed-result fail-closed test.
- Remaining blocker: superseded by
  `standard_peak_low_height_scoped_writer_v1`, which added the explicit
  low-height writer flag and passed the writer expected-diff gate. The bounded
  replay still cannot be silently converted into broad matrix writes.
- Next checkpoint: see `standard_peak_low_height_scoped_writer_v1`.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_height_scoped_writer_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: low-height clean was a strong `production_candidate` after
  bounded-window heldout oracle evidence passed selected 20/20, but there was
  no explicit product writer flag or writer expected-diff approval.
- New tier: `production_ready` for the explicit 57-row low-height-clean scoped
  writer only. Broad 4613-row standard-path activation remains
  `production_candidate`; apex-delta, width-only, and shape-margin remain
  candidate-only probes.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py` now accepts
  `--low-height-clean-activation-scope-audit-tsv`, which fail-closed filters
  matrix-only activation to audit rows with
  `low_height_clean_status=eligible`. The real no-RAW 85RAW run under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/narrow_low_height_clean_no_raw_productization/`
  reports `status=pass`, `activation_scope_contract=low_height_clean_eligible_activation_rows`,
  57 selected/written rows, and `narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json`
  reports `acceptance_status=pass`, `readiness_tier=production_ready`,
  `product_surface_changed=TRUE`, duplicate/missing/unexpected/non-eligible/
  non-written/unchanged/blank all `0`.
- Product surface changed: additive explicit CLI flag and additive scoped
  writer behavior. No default extraction behavior, workbook schema, broad
  Backfill activation, GUI wiring, selected peak/area, or non-standard peak
  policy changed.
- Validation: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest
  tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q` passed `12`; touched
  ruff for productization package/CLI/test passed; real no-RAW writer command
  exited `0`.
- Remaining blocker: none for the explicit 57-row low-height scoped writer.
  Broad 4613-row activation still needs additional named evidence classes and
  expected-diff approval before it can claim `production_ready`.
- Next checkpoint: request subagent review of this writer promotion, then run
  the combined Backfill focused shard and PR gate before commit.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_height_low_scan_scoped_writer_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: low-height-low-scan clean was not a named product slice; broad
  4613-row standard-path activation remained `production_candidate`.
- New tier: `production_ready` for the explicit 69-row
  low-height-low-scan-clean scoped writer only. Broad 4613-row activation
  remains `production_candidate`; apex-delta, width-only, and shape-margin
  remain candidate-only probes.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now supports
  `standard_low_height_low_scan_clean_trace`, which requires height <2e6,
  scan count 7-9, shape >=0.95, local/global >=0.95, width 0.30-0.65 min, and
  apex delta <=0.15 min. The formal no-RAW 85RAW bounded oracle under
  `heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_low_height_low_scan_clean_probe/` found
  210 eligible rows / 51 families, selected 20 family cases, and passed 20/20
  with max boundary error `4.80376e-05 min` and max area relative error
  `0.00881912`. `standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py` now emits
  `low_height_low_scan_clean_status` and found 69 eligible writes in the
  consolidated 4613-row bridge. `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py` now
  accepts `--low-height-low-scan-clean-activation-scope-audit-tsv`, and the
  real no-RAW writer run under
  `narrow_low_height_low_scan_clean_no_raw_productization/` passed 69/69 with
  `readiness_tier=production_ready`, `product_surface_changed=TRUE`, and
  duplicate/missing/unexpected/non-eligible/non-written/unchanged/blank all
  `0`.
- Product surface changed: additive heldout oracle target class, additive audit
  TSV/summary/expected-diff fields and sidecars, additive explicit CLI flag,
  and additive scoped writer behavior. No default extraction behavior,
  workbook schema, broad Backfill activation, GUI wiring, selected peak/area,
  or non-standard peak policy changed.
- Validation: focused Backfill shard
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passed `39` after the reviewer-requested low-height-low-scan blocker table
  test was added; full PR gate passed with `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest -v
  --tb=short -x` (`3742 passed, 1 skipped`), diagnostics index, and
  `git diff --check`; formal no-RAW oracle/audit/writer commands exited `0`.
- Remaining blocker: none for the explicit 69-row low-height-low-scan scoped
  writer. Broad 4613-row activation still needs additional named evidence
  classes and expected-diff approval before it can claim `production_ready`.
- Next checkpoint: done for this scoped writer. Subagent reviewer `Parfit`
  found no blocking finding; remaining Backfill work should move to a new named
  evidence class rather than another existing-predicate writer.

### 2026-06-17 - backfill_remaining_scope_evidence_class_blocker_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier at the time: broad 4613-row standard-path activation was still
  unresolved under the pre-park framing; direct writer work was tempting because
  four narrow scoped writers had reached `production_ready`.
- New tier at the time: direct promotion from the existing
  high-signal/low-scan/low-height/apex/width/shape predicates was blocked. The
  stronger-evidence-class framing is superseded by the later
  `park_broad_backfill` decision and the authority/adjudication contract.
- Evidence: read-only Backfill subagent review confirmed the current safe
  demonstrators are 72 high-signal, 42 low-scan, 57 low-height, and 69
  low-height-low-scan rows. The broad bridge remains 4613 selected writes out
  of 7307 seed-guard candidates, with 2694 low-seed no-writes and 1087 writes
  missing trace/overlay evidence in the activation scope audit. Existing
  candidate probes are not writer-ready: apex-delta is 17/20 with max boundary
  error `2.19621 min`, width-only is 1/3 with max boundary error `1.86561 min`
  and max area relative error `0.599229`, and shape-margin is 6/8 with max
  area relative error `0.198393`.
- Product surface changed: docs/control-plane and handoff wording only. No CLI,
  schema, matrix, workbook, GUI, or extraction default changed.
- Validation: read-only subagent audits `Galileo` and `Feynman`; artifact
  spot-checks of the committed no-RAW 85RAW summaries; no RAW rerun because
  the existing failed probes already answer the direct-writer decision.
- Remaining blocker: superseded for broad auto-write. These ideas can only be
  background for future truth/review/evidence assets unless a later goal names a
  new independent truth source.
- Next checkpoint: historical. Do not design another broad writer evidence
  class from this entry; use the authority/adjudication index to decide whether
  a row needs review, truth labels, or recovered trace evidence.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_reintegration_stability_audit_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: broad 4613-row standard-path activation was
  `production_candidate`, blocked on a new named evidence class beyond the four
  explicit scoped writers.
- New tier: still `production_candidate` for broad activation, now with a
  boundary-stability / reintegration-agreement candidate pool. No
  `production_ready` writer is claimed.
- Evidence: new package/CLI diagnostic
  `standard_peak_reintegration_stability_audit.py` consumes
  `activation_high_signal_clean_scope_audit.tsv`, reloads referenced trace
  JSON, and reintegrates each written trace twice: full trace and
  expected-window-bounded (`padding=0.5 min`). A row is eligible only if both
  reintegration views match the stored reference boundary within `0.1 min`,
  match area within `10%`, and agree with each other within the same boundary
  and area tolerances. The real no-RAW 85RAW run under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/reintegration_stability_audit/`
  reports 4613 written rows, 299 eligible, 3227 ineligible, and 1087 missing
  trace/overlay evidence. 271 eligible rows are outside the existing four ready
  scoped writer envelopes. The summary is intentionally not pass-like:
  `status=candidate_pool_blocked`, `writer_authority_status=blocked`, and
  `production_ready=FALSE`; it also records the upstream activation scope TSV
  SHA and source run id.
- Product surface changed: additive diagnostic CLI/package and additive
  diagnostic TSV/JSON output only. No writer flag, default extraction behavior,
  workbook schema, broad Backfill activation, GUI wiring, selected peak/area,
  or non-standard peak policy changed.
- Validation: TDD red/green focused tests
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_reintegration_stability_audit.py -q`
  now pass `8`; related Backfill shard
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_reintegration_stability_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passes `47`; focused ruff and focused mypy passed; subagent reviewer `Hypatia`
  flagged status/provenance/padding fail-closed gaps and they were fixed; real
  no-RAW 85RAW artifact command exited `0` in about 31 seconds.
- Remaining blocker: this is stored-trace self-consistency evidence, not a
  masked product-writer oracle. Before any writer or `production_ready` claim,
  this candidate pool needs masked/product-writer observed results and
  expected-diff approval.
- Next checkpoint: build the masked/product-writer oracle for the 299-row
  candidate pool, or add another independent evidence class before any writer
  claim.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_low_height_reintegration_stable_writer_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: reintegration-stability audit had promoted a 299-row broader
  candidate pool to stronger `production_candidate`, but writer authority was
  blocked because stored-trace self-consistency alone is not product approval.
- New tier: `production_ready` for the explicit 220-row low-height
  reintegration-stable scoped writer only. Broad 4613-row activation and the
  full 299-row all-stability pool remain `production_candidate`.
- Evidence: the all-stability family check was intentionally not promoted; it
  was later formalized as target
  `standard_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace` and confirmed one
  `fail_area` case
  (`FAM000949/NormalBC2261_DNA`, area relative error `0.19621`). The promoted
  scope is narrower: stability-eligible written rows whose activation audit
  `cell_height` is below `2e6`. Formal no-RAW 85RAW heldout trace oracle
  target `standard_low_height_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace`
  found 220 audit-intersection rows across 66 families, then evaluated detected
  trace candidates from those same families (`match_level=family_id`,
  1520 available candidates), selected 20 family cases, and passed 20/20 with
  max boundary error `0.0830019 min` and max area relative error `0.0725986`.
  The real no-RAW writer under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/narrow_low_height_reintegration_stable_no_raw_productization/`
  selected and wrote 220 cells from the pre-standard-backfill matrix.
  `narrow_product_writer_expected_diff_acceptance.json` reports
  `acceptance_status=pass`, `readiness_tier=production_ready`,
  `expected_scope=low_height_reintegration_stable_eligible_activation_rows`,
  and zero duplicate/missing/unexpected/non-eligible/non-written/unchanged/blank
  blockers. This adds 199 ready cells outside the previous four ready scopes;
  the five-scope ready union is 439 cells.
- Product surface changed: additive CLI/package flags only:
  `standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py --reintegration-stability-audit-tsv`
  / `--activation-scope-audit-tsv` for the family-scope oracle and
  `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py --low-height-reintegration-stable-activation-scope-audit-tsv`
  / `--reintegration-stability-audit-tsv` for the writer. No default
  extraction behavior, workbook schema, GUI, broad Backfill activation,
  selected peak/area, or non-standard peak policy changed.
- Validation: TDD/focused gates passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py::test_heldout_trace_oracle_cli_writes_low_height_stability_family_packet tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py::test_low_height_stability_family_scope_requires_scope_inputs -q`

  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_reintegration_stability_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py tests\test_standard_peak_activation_scope_audit.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  (`52 passed`); focused ruff and focused mypy passed for the touched Backfill
  modules and tests. The real no-RAW oracle and writer commands exited `0`;
  no RAW/85RAW rerun was needed because existing 85RAW trace/productization
  artifacts answered this scope decision. Subagent reviewer `Bernoulli` found
  two blockers before closeout: the oracle wording overclaimed row identity and
  the writer lacked activation-scope schema-version validation. Both were
  fixed. Follow-up reviewer `Avicenna` found no blocking finding; it confirmed
  the claim is now limited to the explicit 220-row writer while all-stability
  299 and broad 4613 remain candidate/blocked.
- Remaining blocker: all-stability direct writer remains blocked by the
  family-check area failure; broad 4613-row activation still needs broader
  masked/product-writer oracle and expected-diff approval. Apex-delta,
  width-only, and shape-margin probes remain blocked by their failed heldout
  oracles.
- Next checkpoint: run the remaining PR gate before commit. The next
  productization slice should broaden by a new evidence class or masked
  product-writer oracle, not by silently widening the new 220-row writer.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_all_stability_family_oracle_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: all-stability 299-row reintegration-stable candidate pool was
  `production_candidate` / writer-blocked based on a quick family check.
- New tier: still `production_candidate` / writer-blocked, now with a formal
  fail-closed oracle artifact. No writer, matrix, workbook, GUI, selected
  peak/area, or default extraction behavior changed.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now supports formal target
  class `standard_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace`. The real
  no-RAW 85RAW oracle packet under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_all_stability_family/`
  records 299 audit-intersection rows across 77 families, expands to 1694
  available detected trace candidates from those families, selects 20 family
  cases, and reports `status=fail`: 19 pass and 1 `fail_area`.
  `FAM000949/NormalBC2261_DNA` has boundary error `0.0626 min` but area
  relative error `0.19621`, above the accepted `0.10` ceiling. This confirms
  that all-stability rows cannot be promoted directly.
- Validation: focused oracle tests
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py -q`
  passed `16` after reviewer `Franklin` requested the high-height/low-height
  boundary regression test; focused ruff and mypy passed for the touched oracle
  module/test. Docs/evidence reviewer `Archimedes` found no blocker and
  confirmed the artifact counts/status/failing case match the docs. The real
  no-RAW oracle command intentionally exited `1` because the artifact failed
  the product oracle, not because the command crashed.
- Remaining blocker: all-stability direct writer needs a narrower
  product-meaningful evidence class, a different independent oracle, or a
  writer contract that can explain and exclude the failing family before any
  matrix write. Broad 4613-row activation still needs broader generated-policy
  evidence with oracle + expected-diff approval.
- Next checkpoint: do not retry direct all-stability writer work. Either add a
  simpler evidence class that explains the 19 pass / 1 fail split, or move the
  next Backfill expansion through the generated policy engine with a separate
  passing oracle and expected-diff gate.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_generated_backfill_policy_explanation_v2

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: generated policy replay over current approved evidence classes
  was `production_ready`, but blocked/detected rows still relied on coarse
  reason strings and the policy summary did not say what evidence each row
  still needed.
- New tier: remains `production_ready` for generated policy replay of current
  approved evidence classes; the policy explanation contract is now
  `standard_peak_backfill_policy_v2`. No broad 4613-row tier promotion.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_backfill_policy.tsv` now requires
  `backfill_policy_decision_basis`, `backfill_policy_next_evidence`, and
  `backfill_policy_candidate_evidence_class` for every generated row. Missing
  explanation fields fail closed before matrix activation. The real no-RAW
  85RAW replay under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/generated_policy_explained_no_raw_productization/`
  produced 4613 explained policy rows with `0` missing explanation rows:
  439 `write_ready`, 72 `detected_flagged`, and 4102 `blocked`. The
  next-evidence distribution is 439 already current-scope approved, 72 needing
  masked/product-writer oracle, 1087 needing trace overlay or reintegration
  evidence, and 3015 needing a new approved evidence class or passing oracle.
  The writer still wrote exactly 439 matrix cells and expected-diff passed
  439/439 with zero blockers.
- Validation: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passed with `22 passed`; the no-RAW 85RAW generated-policy explanation replay
  exited `0` in about 2.36 sec.
- Remaining blocker: the explanation contract makes every current candidate
  accountable, but broad 4613, all-stability 299, apex-delta, width-only, and
  shape-margin still need their own oracle/expected-diff evidence before
  writer authority.
- Next checkpoint: add one new product evidence class to policy v2 only when it
  has a passing oracle/expected-diff gate; otherwise leave the row explained as
  blocked or `detected_flagged`.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_policy_observed_oracle_writer_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: generated policy replay was `production_ready` for 439 current
  approved-evidence rows; 72 boundary-stable rows remained
  `detected_flagged` because they lacked a row-specific product-writer oracle.
- New tier: `production_ready` for generated policy replay of current approved
  evidence classes plus `policy_observed_full_trace_reintegration`. No broad
  4613-row tier promotion.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_policy_observed_oracle.py` evaluates generated
  `detected_flagged` rows against their source activation-scope audit row,
  reloads the full stored trace, recomputes peak boundaries/area, and only
  accepts rows that pass `0.1 min / 10% area`, have
  `included_in_product_acceptance=TRUE`, keep the same row SHA/family/sample,
  remain trace matched/written, and are bound by companion summary JSON to the
  oracle TSV SHA, source audit SHA, and base generated-policy SHA. The real
  no-RAW 85RAW oracle packet under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/policy_observed_oracle_detected_flagged_full_trace/`
  passed 72/72 with max boundary error `8.91875e-05 min` and max area relative
  error `0.098218`. The follow-up generated-policy replay under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/generated_policy_policy_observed_oracle_no_raw_productization/`
  classified 4613 source-audit rows as 511 `write_ready`, 0
  `detected_flagged`, and 4102 `blocked`; writer expected-diff passed 511/511
  with `readiness_tier=production_ready` and zero duplicate/missing/unexpected/
  non-eligible/non-written/unchanged/blank blockers.
- Validation: focused TDD red/green for the new oracle producer and product
  policy connection; `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_policy_observed_oracle.py -q`
  passed with `2 passed`; `uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passed with `29 passed`; focused ruff and mypy passed for the touched
  diagnostics/CLI modules. After subagent review found the bare-TSV allowlist
  gap, the productization consumer now requires
  `--policy-observed-oracle-summary-json` and verifies the oracle/source/base
  policy hashes before promotion. The refreshed no-RAW oracle command exited
  `0` in about 2.08 s and the refreshed no-RAW replay command exited `0` in
  about 3.08 s.
- Remaining blocker at the time: the remaining 4102 blocked rows still needed
  trace overlay / reintegration evidence or another approved evidence class and
  oracle before they could write. The old broad-scope
  `production_candidate` framing is superseded by the 2026-06-18
  `park_broad_backfill` decision.
- Next checkpoint: superseded. Do not use this entry to continue broad
  Backfill broadening; route unresolved rows through authority/adjudication,
  structured review, truth acquisition, or trace-evidence recovery.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_shape_clean_policy_explanation_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: shape-clean reintegration-stable was `production_candidate`
  oracle evidence only; generated policy v2 did not identify it separately from
  generic `reintegration_stable` candidate evidence.
- New tier: still `production_candidate` / explanation evidence only. Generated
  policy replay remains `production_ready` for current approved evidence
  classes, with no broad 4613-row tier promotion and no shape-clean writer
  authority.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py` now treats
  `apex_aligned_shape_similarity` as part of the source activation-scope audit
  contract and records `shape_clean_reintegration_stable` in
  `backfill_policy_candidate_evidence_class` when the row is reintegration
  stable, has `matrix_value_effect=written`, is trace matched and family
  matched, and shape similarity is `>=0.95`. This class is never added to
  `backfill_policy_evidence_class` or
  `ready_evidence_classes` by itself. The real no-RAW 85RAW replay under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/generated_policy_shape_clean_explained_no_raw_productization/`
  still classifies 4613 rows as 439 `write_ready`, 72 `detected_flagged`, and
  4102 `blocked`; the writer still selected/wrote 439 cells and
  `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` expected-diff passed 439/439. Candidate
  evidence distribution now shows 104 rows containing
  `shape_clean_reintegration_stable`: by authority/decision, 30 are
  `review_only` / `detected_flagged` and 74 are already `writer_approved` /
  `write_ready`; by candidate-evidence string, 76 are
  `shape_clean_reintegration_stable,reintegration_stable`, 21 overlap
  `low_height_clean`, and 7 overlap `high_signal_clean`.
- Validation: focused productization tests
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passed after reviewer fixes; focused ruff and mypy passed for the
  productization module/test; the real no-RAW replay exited `0` in about
  2.45 sec. Subagent review found no blocker: Erdos requested negative guard
  tests for trace/shape fail-closed behavior, and Aquinas found the original
  104-row split wording was wrong; both were fixed. Full local gate passed:
  ruff, mypy, pytest `3767 passed, 1 skipped`, diagnostics index, and
  `git diff --check` with Windows LF/CRLF warnings only.
- Remaining blocker: shape-clean stability is explanation evidence until a
  missing-cell scope or masked/product-writer oracle proves nonzero product
  delta. It must not become a public writer flag or a ready evidence class from
  this change alone.
- Next checkpoint: superseded for broad Backfill. Future work should use
  authority/adjudication, structured review, truth acquisition, or trace
  evidence recovery rather than new nested writer flags.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_oracle_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier at the time: shape-clean stability was not a named Backfill
  evidence class; all-stability 299 and broad 4613 were still unresolved /
  writer-blocked under the pre-park framing.
- New tier: `production_candidate` evidence class only. No public writer flag,
  no matrix write, no workbook/schema/GUI/default extraction behavior change.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_heldout_trace_oracle.py` now supports
  `standard_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_candidate_family_trace`, requiring
  reintegration-stability eligible written rows plus activation-scope
  `apex_aligned_shape_similarity >=0.95`. The real no-RAW 85RAW oracle packet
  under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/heldout_trace_reintegration_oracle_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_family/`
  reports `status=pass`, 104 audit-intersection rows / 33 families, 334
  available detected trace candidates / 31 families, selected 20/20 pass, max
  boundary error `0.0830019 min`, and max area relative error `0.0725986`.
  A local temporary writer probe under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/narrow_shape_clean_reintegration_stable_no_raw_productization/`
  was not retained as product code because it failed expected-diff:
  `matrix_cells_written=0`, `product_written_delta_row_count=0`,
  `not_written_delta_row_count=104`, and `unchanged_delta_row_count=104`.
- Validation: real no-RAW oracle command exited `0` in about 7.84 sec. Focused
  oracle tests passed with `19 passed` after reviewer `Sartre` requested an
  explicit missing-`apex_aligned_shape_similarity` fail-closed regression test.
  Docs/evidence reviewer `Heisenberg` found no overclaim blocker and requested
  the WIP-table stop rule now reflected above. Full local gate passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3764 passed, 1 skipped`);
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts\check_diagnostics_index.py`;
  `git diff --check` had no whitespace errors, only Windows LF/CRLF warnings.
- Remaining blocker: this shape-clean class currently proves that already
  detected/pre-existing matrix-value families reintegrate cleanly. It does not
  prove a missing-cell writer effect. To promote it, route it through generated
  policy as explanation-only evidence or build a missing-cell candidate scope
  with nonzero expected-diff and the same oracle/expected-diff acceptance.
- Next checkpoint: do not add a shape-clean public writer flag. The broadening
  clause is superseded; shape-clean evidence can remain explanatory candidate
  context only unless a future authority/truth/expected-diff goal reopens it.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_generated_backfill_policy_path_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: five explicit scoped writers were `production_ready`; broad
  4613-row activation and the all-stability 299-row pool remained
  `production_candidate` / writer-blocked. The implementation path was drifting
  toward more nested scoped writer flags.
- New tier: `production_ready` for generated policy replay of the current
  approved evidence classes. No broad 4613-row tier promotion: rows outside the
  approved evidence classes remain `detected_flagged` or `blocked` until their
  own oracle and expected-diff evidence exists.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py` now accepts
  `--backfill-policy-source-audit-tsv`, generates
  `standard_peak_backfill_policy.tsv` plus summary, and classifies each source
  audit row as `write_ready`, `detected_flagged`, or `blocked`. The generated
  policy schema is now `standard_peak_backfill_policy_v2`; every row must carry
  `backfill_policy_decision_basis`, `backfill_policy_next_evidence`, and
  `backfill_policy_candidate_evidence_class`. The CLI does not expose a
  human-authored activation policy TSV, and the public package API does not
  accept `activation_policy_tsv`. `write_ready` rows fail closed unless they are
  written rows with matched trace evidence, a nonblank evidence class, and
  `writer_approved` authority; every policy row fails closed if explanation
  fields are blank. Focused tests prove a four-row broad source audit produces
  one high-signal `write_ready`, one low-height stability `write_ready`, one
  `detected_flagged`, and one `blocked`, and only the two `write_ready` rows
  alter the matrix. Additional negative tests cover trace-mismatch clean-status
  contradictions and the missing public manual policy TSV entry point. The real
  no-RAW 85RAW replay under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/generated_policy_explained_no_raw_productization/`
  consumed the existing 4613-row consolidated source audit plus the
  reintegration-stability audit, generated 439 `write_ready`, 72
  `detected_flagged`, and 4102 `blocked` policy rows, selected/wrote 439 matrix
  cells, passed `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` expected-diff with zero
  blockers, and had `0` missing explanation rows. Its next-evidence counts are
  439 `none_current_scope_writer_approved`, 72
  `masked_or_product_writer_oracle_required`, 1087
  `trace_overlay_or_reintegration_evidence_required`, and 3015
  `approved_evidence_class_or_passing_oracle_required`.
- Validation: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor\diagnostics\standard_peak_backfill_productization.py tools\diagnostics\standard_peak_backfill_productization.py tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py`
  passed; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passed with `22 passed`. Subagent reviewers `Faraday` and `Meitner` found
  policy/manual-allowlist, trace-evidence, stale acceptance-scope, stale board,
  and next-action wording gaps; all were fixed before closeout. Full local gate
  then passed: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`; `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3759 passed, 1 skipped`); `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts\check_diagnostics_index.py`;
  and the latest no-RAW generated-policy explanation replay command exited `0`
  in about 2.36 sec.
- Remaining blocker: generated policy currently only unifies existing approved
  evidence classes. It does not make apex-delta, width-only, shape-margin,
  all-stability, or broad 4613 rows production-ready without their own oracle
  and expected-diff approval.
- Next checkpoint: superseded for broad Backfill. Future evidence classes may be
  considered only under a new independent truth-source / expected-diff goal;
  this entry must not be used as permission to mine another writer slice.

### 2026-06-18 - bounded_non_broad_lane_acceptance_v1

- Lane: Targeted non-broad production lanes / bounded continuation guard.
- Previous tier: Targeted MS1 limited rescue and SampleMetadata no-output
  projection were individually `production_ready`; ReviewAction candidate
  sidecar was `production_candidate`; broader target rescue, role-driven value
  behavior, selected-candidate switch, and manual-boundary area writer were
  blocked or parked, but there was no compact guard tying these non-broad lanes
  to the machine status index.
- New tier: `production_candidate` bounded-lane guard. This does not change
  product behavior or writer authority.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/bounded_non_broad_product_lanes.v1.json`
  defines the acceptance schema.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/bounded_non_broad_lane_acceptance_v1.tsv`
  records seven non-broad lane outcomes and binds to
  `docs/superpowers/validation/productization_status_index_v1.tsv`
  (`sha256=16C5CF817D216C82C891EFE7FBC319D89F477353BF50E7EBE004EF6411625A95`).
  `scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py` validates that broad Backfill is
  absent, readiness matches the status index, no row grants new product
  authority or ProductWriter input, GUI/target expansion are disabled, blocked
  or parked rows have no effect/scope, Targeted MS1 is limited to
  `limited_5hmdc_5medc_v1;5-hmdC;5-medC` with `detected_flagged_only`, and
  SampleMetadata / ReviewAction effects stay no-output or identity-only.
- Product surface changed: docs/spec/validation/test/helper script only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, or GUI behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`
  returned `Bounded non-broad product lanes are consistent and fail-closed.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_bounded_product_lanes_contract.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `12`; focused ruff passed for `scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`
  and `tests/test_bounded_product_lanes_contract.py`. Subagent review found
  status-index/source-hash self-attestation, status-index extra/risk-row, and
  schema+TSV+status coordinated-promotion gaps. They were fixed by chaining
  `check_productization_state.py`, binding hash checks to the supplied status
  index, hardcoding the bounded readiness sets in the checker, documenting
  `current_bounded_surface` as non-authority, and adding focused negative
  tests for each failure mode. Post-fix subagent review re-ran the original
  mutation probes and found no P0/P1/P2/P3 findings. Full local gate passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests scripts/build_trace_overlay_recovery_report.py scripts/build_peak_choice_truth_lockbox.py scripts/check_productization_authority.py scripts/check_productization_state.py scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_authority.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3825 passed, 1 skipped`);
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_diagnostics_index.py`;
  `git diff --check` passed with LF/CRLF warnings only.
- Remaining blocker: this guard does not collect new Targeted MS1 evidence,
  alter SampleMetadata role behavior, or implement ReviewAction selected
  candidate / manual-boundary writeback.
- Next checkpoint: commit this Goal 6 slice. Future non-broad lane changes must
  update this guard or explicitly supersede it.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_label_collection_pack_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: `production_candidate` truth-lockbox protocol and 72-case
  sampling manifest existed, but the lockbox was not yet packaged for
  structured human labeling.
- New tier: unchanged for product authority. The label-collection pack is a
  `production_candidate` truth/approval substrate: it can collect independent
  labels later, but it does not grant ProductWriter authority.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/lockbox_label_schema_v1.json` defines
  legal labels for peak choice, area, boundary, reviewer confidence, reason
  code, notes, source hashes, and no-authority flags.
  `scripts/build_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py` generates 72 Markdown
  packets under
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_review_packets_v1/`, the paired
  `packet_index.tsv`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_label_template_v1.tsv` with 144 blank
  reviewer rows. Each packet records row identity, candidate peak/area summary,
  trace/overlay/hypothesis paths and hashes when available, recovered-evidence
  context or an explicit missing-evidence reason, current machine decision, and
  the exact review question. `scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py` validates
  schema, packets, hashes, template structure, enum values, duplicate completed
  reviewer IDs, label identity fields, source-hash binding, canonical packet
  paths, and no-authority flags. Its default mode is hermetic for clean
  checkouts and does not require ignored local `output/` artifacts;
  `--verify-evidence-files` performs the stronger local file-existence/hash
  check on machines that have the referenced evidence files. `--require-complete`
  is reserved for the later completed-label import gate.
- Product surface changed: docs/spec/validation/helper script/test only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, broad Backfill, or GUI
  behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py`
  built 72 packets and 144 template rows;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py`
  returned `Lockbox label collection pack is structurally valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py --verify-evidence-files`
  also passed on the current machine;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `15`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/build_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py tests/test_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py`
  passed. Subagent review found no authority-boundary findings, then identified
  data-contract gaps for non-hermetic evidence validation, completed-label
  evidence/hash binding, free-form reason codes, noncanonical packet paths, and
  label identity drift. All were fixed with focused regression tests; final
  post-fix review found no P0/P1/P2/P3 findings. Final full local gate is still
  passed before committing this checkpoint:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py --verify-evidence-files`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests scripts/build_trace_overlay_recovery_report.py scripts/build_peak_choice_truth_lockbox.py scripts/check_productization_authority.py scripts/check_productization_state.py scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py scripts/build_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_authority.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_diagnostics_index.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3840 passed, 1 skipped`); `git diff --check` passed with LF/CRLF warnings
  only.
- Remaining blocker: no human labels have been collected. The next gate must
  import completed labels and summarize independent peak-choice / area truth;
  it must not treat round-trip oracle, ISTD, empty template rows, or lockbox
  membership as ground truth.
- Historical next checkpoint at the time: commit Goal 7, then proceed to a label
  import / truth summary gate only after completed labels exist. Goal 7 was
  later committed as `dcd8878a`; the active follow-up is the Goal 9 static
  review UX checkpoint below.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_static_review_ux_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: `production_candidate` label-collection pack existed with 72
  Markdown packets and a 144-row empty label template, but human review still
  required opening TSV/Markdown plus external trace/overlay artifacts by hand.
- New tier: unchanged for product authority. The static review UX is a
  `production_candidate` review substrate only; it does not collect labels and
  does not grant ProductWriter authority.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py` reads the existing
  `lockbox_review_packets_v1/packet_index.tsv`, selects the matching sample
  trace from each trace JSON, applies the existing
  `gaussian15_morphology_trace` (`gaussian_15`, 15 points), derives the
  primary review boundary from the existing chromatographic peak-segment
  baseline-return logic, and writes
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_static_review_v1/`. The generated bundle
  contains `index.html`, `bundle_index.tsv`, 72 case HTML pages, and 53 PNG
  review plots with Gaussian-derived boundaries. The 18 rows without trace
  evidence are rendered as explicit missing-evidence pages, and one trace file
  with no positive signal is rendered as
  `gaussian_review_boundary_unavailable`, instead of synthetic plots.
- Product surface changed: docs/validation/helper script/test only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, broad Backfill, or GUI
  behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py`
  built 72 cases and 53 Gaussian15 plots;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox static review bundle is valid and non-authoritative.`
  after checking the current packet-index hash, label-template hash, source
  artifact hashes, and visible row identity fields;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `11`, including stale packet-index, label-template, source-hash,
  browser-case Gaussian-boundary, and synthetic zero-signal regression tests;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/build_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py tests/test_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py`
  passed. Subagent review found one stale-bundle checker gap and one stale
  historical-checkpoint wording gap; both were fixed. Follow-up subagent review
  found no P1/P2/P3 findings for the Gaussian-boundary display fix. Final local
  gate passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests scripts/build_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_authority.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_static_review_bundle.py --check-only`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_diagnostics_index.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3851 passed, 1 skipped`); `git diff --check` passed with LF/CRLF
  warnings only.
- Remaining blocker: no human labels have been collected. The UX reduces manual
  review friction but does not replace independent reviewer labels or the later
  label import / truth summary gate.
- Next checkpoint: use the HTML bundle for a small first labeling batch before
  starting label import.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_truth_summary_gate_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: `production_candidate` label-collection and static-review
  substrate existed, but no reviewer labels had been imported into a truth
  summary.
- New tier: unchanged for product authority. The truth-summary gate is a
  `production_candidate` review-only evidence packet. It does not grant
  ProductWriter authority and does not reopen broad Backfill.
- Evidence: `scripts/import_lockbox_labels.py` imports the user's first
  2026-06-18 visual pass over
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_static_review_v1/bundle_index.tsv`.
  It writes
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_reviewer_label_log_v1.tsv`,
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_truth_summary_v1.json`,
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_truth_confusion_table_v1.tsv`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_failure_modes_v1.tsv`. The import binds
  each label to the static bundle hash, case HTML hash, plot hash or plot
  status, source artifact hashes, row identity, legal label enums, and
  no-authority flags. Current summary: 72 one-reviewer labels imported; 53
  assessable Gaussian15 static review plots are labeled `correct` /
  `acceptable` / `acceptable`; 19 cases are `insufficient_evidence` /
  `not_assessable`; decision is `truth_supports_review_only`.
- Product surface changed: docs/validation/helper script/test only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, broad Backfill, or GUI
  behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/import_lockbox_labels.py --generate-user-batch-log`
  built the label log and truth-summary artifacts;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/import_lockbox_labels.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox truth summary gate is valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_truth_summary.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `8`, including stale static-hash, authority-flag,
  duplicate-reviewer, and two-reviewer clean-label future-path regression
  tests;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_productization_state_index.py -v --tb=short`
  passed with `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1` bound to
  `lockbox_truth_summary_v1.json`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/import_lockbox_labels.py tests/test_lockbox_truth_summary.py`
  passed. Subagent review found one P2 status-index binding gap and one P3
  future two-reviewer import-path gap; both were fixed by updating the status
  index/checker coverage and allowing multiple reviewer rows per case while
  rejecting duplicate reviewer IDs.
- Remaining blocker: this is one reviewer pass, not the completed two-reviewer
  lockbox. The 19 not-assessable cases still need recovered visual evidence or
  explicit park/insufficient-evidence handling. This gate cannot support an
  automation or writer experiment until independent truth coverage and
  expected-diff authority exist.
- Next checkpoint: superseded by `lockbox_next_action_plan_v1`, which splits the
  coarse 19 not-assessable cases into manual-negative controls,
  round-trip-oracle parked negatives, and one boundary-unavailable evidence gap.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_next_action_plan_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` review-only truth-summary
  gate. The imported batch had 53 assessable labels and 19 coarse
  not-assessable labels.
- New tier: unchanged for product authority. The next-action packet is a
  `production_candidate` review-routing packet only; it does not grant
  ProductWriter authority and does not reopen broad Backfill.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_lockbox_next_action_plan.py` reads the static review
  bundle, imported reviewer label log, and truth-summary gate, then writes
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_next_action_plan_v1.tsv` and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_next_action_summary_v1.json`. Current
  split: 53 `ready_for_second_independent_review`, 6
  `use_existing_manual_negative_control`, 12
  `park_roundtrip_oracle_negative_as_nontruth`, and 1
  `recover_or_mark_gaussian_boundary_unavailable`. Every row has
  `may_feed_product_writer=FALSE`, `may_touch_matrix=FALSE`, and
  `may_grant_product_authority=FALSE`.
- Product surface changed: docs/validation/helper script/test only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, broad Backfill, or GUI
  behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_next_action_plan.py`
  built the next-action artifacts;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_next_action_plan.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox next-action plan is valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_next_action_plan.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `13`, including manual-negative separation, round-trip-oracle parking,
  second-review routing, boundary-unavailable routing, stale-plan, stale-summary,
  summary-authority, extra-summary-authority-key, parked-flag, and
  row-authority regressions;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/build_lockbox_next_action_plan.py tests/test_lockbox_next_action_plan.py`
  passed. Subagent review found two P2 fail-closed gaps and three P3
  data-flow/test gaps; all were fixed. Final post-fix subagent review found no
  P0/P1/P2/P3 findings. Full local gate after fixes passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests scripts/build_lockbox_next_action_plan.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3873 passed, 1 skipped`);
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_diagnostics_index.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_authority.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`;

  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_next_action_plan.py --check-only`.
- Remaining blocker: the 53 plotted clean cases still need a second independent
  reviewer before any automation experiment. The 12 round-trip oracle negatives
  remain parked as non-truth; the 6 manual negatives are controls only; the 1
  boundary-unavailable case needs signal/evidence recovery or remains
  not-assessable.
- Next checkpoint: superseded by `lockbox_second_review_pack_v1`, which creates
  the blank reviewer-slot-2 collection surface for the 53 plotted clean cases.
  Do not mine another broad Backfill heuristic.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_second_review_pack_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` next-action routing packet.
  The current gate had 53 plotted Gaussian15 cases ready for a second
  independent reviewer, plus 19 cases excluded from that route.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`. This is a second-review
  collection packet only; it does not grant ProductWriter, matrix, workbook,
  selected peak/area, counted-detection, default extraction, GUI, or broad
  Backfill authority.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py` reads
  `lockbox_next_action_plan_v1.tsv`, the static Gaussian15 review bundle, and
  the first reviewer label log. It writes
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_second_review_queue_v1.tsv`,
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_second_review_template_v1.tsv`,
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_second_review_summary_v1.json`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_second_review_v1/index.html`.
  Current split: 53 reviewer-slot-2 rows are blank and linked to existing
  Gaussian15 overlay pages; 19 non-ready cases are excluded from this collection
  pack. Every queue/template row keeps no-authority flags false.
- Product surface changed: docs/validation/helper script/test only. It adds a
  review-collection TSV/HTML surface, not a writer surface. No ProductWriter,
  matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection, workbook schema,
  CLI/config, extraction default, broad Backfill, or GUI behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py`
  built the second-review artifacts;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox second-review pack is valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_second_review_pack.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `11`, including exact 53-case routing, blank slot-2 template,
  Gaussian15 contract, HTML link smoke, actual PNG hash anchoring,
  no-authority flags, stale-summary, stale-template, and queue-authority
  regressions;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py tests/test_lockbox_second_review_pack.py`
  passed. Subagent review found one P2 stale plot-hash anchoring gap and one P3
  broken HTML template link; both were fixed before commit. Post-fix subagent
  re-review found no P0/P1/P2/P3 findings. Final full local gate after those
  fixes passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3884 passed, 1 skipped`);

  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py --check-only`.
- Remaining blocker: a second independent human reviewer is not currently
  available because the user is the sole domain owner. Subagents may perform
  adversarial QA and visual contradiction checks, but they must not be recorded
  as `reviewer_slot=2` human truth labels. These labels still cannot become
  write authority without a later expected-diff product goal.
- Next checkpoint: finish subagent QA and route any flagged cases back to the
  owner. If no second human reviewer exists, create a separate
  non-authoritative AI-challenge record or an explicitly approved downgraded
  single-owner + AI-challenge evidence contract before rerunning the truth
  summary gate. Do not route the 19 excluded cases into broad Backfill
  heuristics.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_reviewer_identity_guard_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` second-review collection
  packet. Docs said subagents could only do QA/challenge review, but the
  completed-label checker and truth-summary import gate still only required
  distinct reviewer IDs.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`. This is a fail-closed review
  identity guard and owner-boundary record; it does not grant ProductWriter,
  matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted-detection, default extraction,
  GUI, or broad Backfill authority.
- Evidence: `scripts/lockbox_reviewer_identity.py` enforces the explicit human
  truth reviewer registry in `lockbox_label_schema_v1.json`; unregistered
  reviewer IDs, including agent/subagent/model-looking IDs, cannot satisfy
  human truth labels. The guard is enforced by
  `scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py --require-complete` and
  `scripts/import_lockbox_labels.py --check-only`. The truth-summary import gate
  also now rejects malformed reviewer-slot logs and requires valid slot 1/2
  semantics before the automation-experiment decision can be reached. The label
  schema records that AI challenge review must be stored outside human truth
  slots. The owner boundary confirmation is recorded in
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_owner_boundary_confirmation_v1.json`,
  with hashes for the static bundle, label log, truth summary, and next-action
  summary; it explicitly forbids ProductWriter,
  matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted-detection, default extraction,
  GUI, and broad Backfill authority.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_owner_boundary_confirmation.py tests/test_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py tests/test_lockbox_truth_summary.py -v --tb=short`

  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py`
  passed;

  passed;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`
  passed.
- Remaining blocker: no second independent human reviewer exists. Subagents may
  flag contradictions and implementation issues, but cannot satisfy
  `reviewer_slot=2`.
- Next checkpoint: superseded by `lockbox_ai_challenge_packet_v1`, which creates
  the separate non-authoritative AI/subagent QA surface without filling
  reviewer slot 2.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_ai_challenge_packet_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` reviewer-identity guard. The
  owner/domain review was recorded, and AI/subagent review was explicitly kept
  out of human truth slots, but there was no separate artifact for low-manual
  challenge review.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`. This is a non-authoritative
  challenge QA packet; it does not grant ProductWriter, matrix, workbook,
  selected peak/area, counted-detection, default extraction, GUI, truth-label,
  reviewer-slot-2, or broad Backfill authority.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py` reads
  `lockbox_next_action_plan_v1.tsv`, the static Gaussian15 review bundle, the
  owner label log, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_owner_boundary_confirmation_v1.json`.
  It writes `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_ai_challenge_queue_v1.tsv`,
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_ai_challenge_template_v1.tsv`,
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_ai_challenge_summary_v1.json`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_ai_challenge_v1/index.html`. Current
  split: all 72 lockbox cases are present; 53 are visual contradiction checks
  against owner-confirmed Gaussian15 plots, and 19 are route/evidence integrity
  checks only. Only the 53 visual rows allow
  `visual_contradiction_suspected`; the 19 route/evidence rows do not. The
  template is blank and every no-authority flag is false.
- Product surface changed: docs/validation/helper script/test only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, GUI, broad Backfill, or
  truth-label behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py`
  built the packet;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox AI challenge packet is valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `12`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/build_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py tests/test_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py`

  passed.
- Subagent review: read-only reviewer found the route/evidence output-scope
  leak and stale HTML/summary coverage gap. Both were fixed before commit.
- Remaining blocker: AI challenge results are not yet filled or reviewed, and
  even filled AI findings can only flag owner re-review. They cannot satisfy
  human truth completion.
- Next checkpoint: commit this non-authoritative challenge packet, then run or
  fill challenge results and route only flagged cases back to the owner.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_ai_challenge_result_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` challenge packet ready for 72
  cases, but challenge results were not yet filled.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`. This is a non-authoritative
  challenge result log and summary; it does not satisfy reviewer slot 2 and
  does not grant ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area,
  counted-detection, default extraction, GUI, truth-label, or broad Backfill
  authority.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_ai_challenge_result_log_v1.tsv`
  records 72 challenge rows from three read-only subagent chunks plus one main
  agent chunk. `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_ai_challenge_result_summary_v1.json`
  reports `decision=ai_challenge_owner_recheck_required`: 71 rows are
  `no_issue`; 1 row,
  `LOCKBOXV1_60CEB35837FAF38CC4DE9021`, is
  `visual_contradiction_suspected` and must be routed only to owner re-review.
- Product surface changed: docs/validation/helper script/test/output artifact
  only. No ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted
  detection, workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, GUI, broad
  Backfill, or truth-label behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_ai_challenge_results.py`
  built the result summary with 72 cases and 1 flagged case;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_ai_challenge_results.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox AI challenge results are valid and non-authoritative.`;
  focused pytest and ruff for the result checker were added and run.
- Remaining blocker: the single flagged case needs owner re-review before it can
  be treated as resolved. Even owner resolution still cannot become writer
  authority without a later authority manifest and expected-diff product goal.
- Next checkpoint: build a tiny owner re-review packet for
  `LOCKBOXV1_60CEB35837FAF38CC4DE9021`, or wait for owner review if the current
  HTML/plot is enough.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_ai_challenge_owner_rule_resolution_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` with one
  `ai_challenge_owner_recheck_required` flag for
  `LOCKBOXV1_60CEB35837FAF38CC4DE9021`.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`; the AI challenge result now has
  no open owner re-review flag. This closure does not satisfy reviewer slot 2
  and does not grant ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area,
  counted-detection, default extraction, GUI, truth-label, or broad Backfill
  authority.
- Evidence: the owner clarified the double-peak rule for raw traces: if the
  Backfill/detect reference apex is on the left peak, keep the current clean
  decision; if it is indistinguishable or on the right peak, keep the case
  flagged. Existing recovered trace evidence for
  `LOCKBOXV1_60CEB35837FAF38CC4DE9021` records
  `cell_apex_rt=15.1553` and `trace_apex_rt=15.1553` on the left peak, while
  the competing right peak is around `15.4366`. The result row now records
  `challenge_result=no_issue` and
  `challenge_reason_code=owner_rule_detected_left_peak_resolved`.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_ai_challenge_result_summary_v1.json`
  reports `decision=ai_challenge_no_owner_recheck_required`: 72 `no_issue`,
  0 flagged.
- Product surface changed: validation artifact/schema enum, focused tests, and
  docs/status indexes only. No ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected
  peak/area, counted detection, workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction
  default, GUI, broad Backfill, or truth-label behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_ai_challenge_results.py`
  rebuilt the result summary with 72 cases and 0 flagged cases;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_ai_challenge_results.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox AI challenge results are valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`
  returned `Productization state index is consistent and fail-closed.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_bounded_product_lanes.py`
  returned `Bounded non-broad product lanes are consistent and fail-closed.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_ai_challenge_results.py tests/test_productization_state_index.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `16`; focused ruff passed for the changed checker/tests.
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_diagnostics_index.py`
  returned `INDEX.md in sync: 90 entry points, 169 total files.`;
  `git diff --check` returned only LF/CRLF warnings.
  Read-only subagent review passed with no blocking findings and confirmed the
  trace artifact, hashes, status index, and no-authority boundary.
- Remaining blocker: none for the AI challenge flag. Future automation still
  needs an explicit authority manifest update and expected-diff product goal
  before any label, challenge output, or review evidence can write product
  values.
- Next checkpoint: continue from the truth/review substrate. Do not convert this
  closure into writer authority; use it only to unblock later truth-summary or
  review-workflow experiments.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_second_review_ai_challenge_gate_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` AI challenge result with
  `decision=ai_challenge_no_owner_recheck_required`, 72 `no_issue`, and
  0 flagged cases. The second-review collection pack existed, but it was not
  mechanically gated on the closed AI challenge result.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`. The current active artifact is
  now `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_second_review_summary_v1.json`
  (`decision=second_review_collection_ready_for_53_cases`). It remains a
  truth/review collection surface only; it grants no ProductWriter, matrix,
  workbook, selected peak/area, counted-detection, GUI, default extraction, or
  broad Backfill authority.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py` now requires the AI
  challenge result summary to be current and to report
  `ai_challenge_no_owner_recheck_required` with zero flagged cases before the
  second-review pack can validate. The summary records the upstream AI
  challenge decision and hash. `lockbox_owner_boundary_confirmation_v1.json`
  was corrected to avoid a cyclic source-artifact chain: owner boundary now
  records only upstream human-review evidence and no longer hashes downstream
  second-review summaries. AI challenge queue/template/result metadata were
  regenerated only to point at that non-cyclic owner-boundary artifact; the
  challenge results stayed 72 `no_issue`.
- Product surface changed: validation artifact schemas/content, helper script,
  focused tests, status index, and docs only. No ProductWriter, matrix,
  workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection, workbook schema, CLI/config,
  extraction default, GUI, broad Backfill, or truth-label behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox AI challenge packet is valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_ai_challenge_results.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox AI challenge results are valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_second_review_pack.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox second-review pack is valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_second_review_pack.py tests/test_lockbox_ai_challenge_results.py tests/test_lockbox_ai_challenge_pack.py tests/test_lockbox_owner_boundary_confirmation.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `32`.
- Remaining blocker: this still does not create second human labels. The next
  product step is to collect/import the second independent review labels, or
  explicitly define a future single-owner plus AI-challenge evidence contract.
  Either path still needs a separate expected-diff and authority goal before
  writer authority can expand.
- Next checkpoint: run productization state/lane/diagnostics checks, subagent
  review, then commit the scoped gate. Do not use this gate to unpark broad
  Backfill or promote labels/challenge output into writer authority.

### 2026-06-18 - lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` second-review collection
  gate. The second-review pack was valid only after AI challenge closure, but
  the lane still required either second-human labels or a separate contract for
  the single-owner + AI-challenge evidence path.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`. Current active artifact is
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate_v1.json`
  with
  `decision=single_owner_ai_challenge_supports_shadow_automation_experiment`.
  This allows only a later shadow automation experiment design. It is not
  two-human truth completion and does not grant ProductWriter, matrix, workbook,
  selected peak/area, counted-detection, GUI, default extraction, or broad
  Backfill authority.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate.py` checks
  the current truth summary (`truth_supports_review_only`), AI challenge result
  summary (`ai_challenge_no_owner_recheck_required`, zero flagged), second
  review summary (`second_review_collection_ready_for_53_cases`), and
  non-cyclic owner-boundary confirmation. Output records 53 owner-clean
  Gaussian15 cases, 19 excluded/not-assessable cases, and 0 product-authority
  rows.
- Product surface changed: validation decision JSON, helper script, focused
  tests, status index, and docs only. No ProductWriter, matrix, workbook,
  selected peak/area, counted detection, workbook schema, CLI/config,
  extraction default, GUI, broad Backfill, or truth-label behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate.py`
  built the gate;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox single-owner AI challenge gate is valid and non-authoritative.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `8`, including stale truth summary, stale second-review summary,
  AI-flag, owner-boundary-cycle, owner-boundary-hash, and authority-drift
  regressions;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/build_lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate.py tests/test_lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate.py`
  passed.
- Remaining blocker: this gate supports only shadow experiment design. Any
  ProductWriter authority expansion still needs a separate masked/product-writer
  oracle, expected-diff, and explicit authority-manifest update.
- Next checkpoint: design the shadow automation experiment around the 53
  owner-clean + AI-no-flag cases while keeping 19 excluded cases out of writer
  scope. Do not treat this gate as `reviewer_slot=2` or broad Backfill
  authority.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Default Product Activation v1

- Lane: Backfill default QuantMatrix ProductWriter activation / Phase 11.
- Previous tier: `product_ready_default_matrix_candidate`, which still
  required an explicit ProductWriter/default output activation commit.
- New tier: `product_ready_default_matrix_activated`. The current 511-cell
  authority is now materialized as default quant matrix output. Authority scope
  and row count remain unchanged: `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows`, 511
  accepted Backfill cells, broad 4613-row Backfill still parked.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_default_product_activation_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_default_product_activation.py`,
  `tests/test_quant_matrix_default_product_activation.py`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/quant_matrix_default_product_activation_v1/`.
- Product surface changed: explicit default output files are now written:
  `default_output/quant_matrix.tsv`, `default_output/cell_provenance.tsv`,
  `default_output/row_summary.tsv`,
  `default_output/expected_diff_summary.tsv`,
  `default_output/source_summary.tsv`,
  `default_product_activation_checks.tsv`, and
  `quant_matrix_default_product_activation_summary.json`.
- Evidence: default `--check-only` fail-closes to
  `source_run_id=seed-guard-realdata-85raw-generated-policy-policy-observed-oracle-20260617`,
  `downstream_scope=current_511_authority_replay`, and
  `accepted_backfill_count=511`. The checker revalidates the Phase 7 real
  bundle and Phase 10 Product Ready closeout, reruns manifest-driven
  activation, checks source hashes, requires expected-diff closure, and compares
  the default outputs with the Phase 7 reference hashes.
- Current validation result: activation status is `pass`; 511 expected,
  511 accepted Backfill written, and 0 unused expected-diff rows. Default
  `quant_matrix.tsv`, `cell_provenance.tsv`, `row_summary.tsv`, and
  `expected_diff_summary.tsv` match the Phase 7 reference hashes. The sidecar
  records 17489 detected cells, 511 accepted Backfill cells, and 18000
  quant-available cells.
- Product surface not changed: No workbook, GUI, selected peak, selected area,
  counted detection, review/replay behavior, broad Backfill authority, scorer,
  RAW, or 85RAW changed. Accepted Backfill values are quantification values in
  the default matrix, not detections or truth claims.
- Status-index update: updated the writer row's current artifact/public surface
  to this activation summary and `quant_matrix_default_product_activation_v1`.
  The writer row count and product authority scope remain exactly 511 and
  `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows`.
- Next checkpoint: maintain this default output through the authority manifest,
  expected-diff checks, and focused public-surface tests; do not expand Backfill
  authority without a new authority goal.

### 2026-06-19 - Target-row identity gap stop-ship addendum

- Lane: Default QuantMatrix target-row identity / targeted ISTD benchmark
  semantics.
- Previous tier: `product_ready_default_matrix_activated` for the 511-cell
  default matrix activation bundle.
- New tier: unchanged. The 511-cell matrix writer authority, active lane,
  `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` scope, and broad Backfill parked state are
  unchanged. This addendum changes diagnostic/review semantics and records a
  target-row identity blocker; it does not change ProductWriter output files or
  matrix authority.
- Evidence: user review found `d4-N6-2HE-dA` target `m/z=300.1605` absent from
  `quant_matrix.tsv`. Investigation showed the final matrix has nearby rows
  `299.155` and valid isotope-shift dR-tag feature row `301.165`, but no exact
  target row for `300.1605`.
  Discovery artifacts under `local_validation_artifacts/discovery/accepted_p8b/85raw`
  contain `0` 22-25 min monoisotopic `300.1605 -> 184.113` candidates and
  `160` isotope-shift `301.165 -> 185.116` candidates spanning all 85 samples.
  Existing targeted ISTD benchmark output had incorrectly selected `FAM007866`
  as a primary `d4-N6-2HE-dA` row despite `match_type=isotope_shift`.
- Product surface changed: targeted ISTD benchmark summaries now count only
  `match_type=exact` rows as primary matches, and matrix identity blast-radius
  joins no longer promote isotope-shift benchmark rows to
  `active_dna_istd_candidate`. Output schemas are unchanged; review/replay
  classification semantics are stricter.
- Validation: focused red/green tests now cover isotope-only active ISTD
  failing as `MISS` and blast-radius refusing to promote isotope-shift target
  aliases. `uv run pytest tests/test_targeted_istd_benchmark.py tests/test_matrix_identity_blast_radius.py -v --tb=short`
  passed 25 tests. A no-RAW recheck over the existing targeted workbook and
  alignment TSV/XLSX artifacts writes
  `tmp_runtime/targeted_istd_benchmark_d4_recheck_20260619/` and reports
  `d4-N6-2HE-dA status=FAIL`, `failure_modes=MISS`,
  `primary_match_count=0`; `FAM007866` remains visible only as
  `match_type=isotope_shift`.
- Remaining blocker: the activated default matrix remains numerically usable for
  downstream wide-matrix analysis, but release-facing target/ISTD lookup is not
  product-ready for `d4-N6-2HE-dA` until active targets can materialize exact
  target-anchored product rows and the default activation expected-diff bundle
  is regenerated. Keep `301.165` as its own valid feature row; do not bridge it
  back to `300.1605` as authority or treat it as a reason to suppress the
  missing monoisotopic row.

### 2026-06-19 - Discovery precursor inference root-cause fix v1

- Lane: Untargeted discovery row identity / target-row stop-ship remediation.
- Previous tier: unchanged from
  `product_ready_default_matrix_activated` for the current 511-cell default
  matrix activation bundle, with `d4-N6-2HE-dA` release-facing target lookup
  blocked by the missing exact row.
- New tier: unchanged. This fixes discovery generation behavior and artifact
  identity only. It does not promote a new maturity tier, change active lane,
  alter ProductWriter authority, regenerate the default matrix, unpark broad
  Backfill, or change workbook/GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted
  detection, review/replay, scorer, RAW/85RAW authority, or current 511-cell
  Backfill authority.
- Root cause: `xic_extractor.discovery.ms2_seeds` used the Thermo MS2 filter
  precursor as the only exact precursor when searching for
  `precursor - neutral_loss` products. For `TumorBC2312_DNA`, RAW MS2 scans in
  the 22-25 min window include filter precursor `300.2028` with product
  `184.1132`; `184.1132 + 116.0474 = 300.1606`, but the old direct-only search
  looked near `184.1554` and rejected the row before grouping/alignment.
- Product surface changed: `DiscoverySettings` and `scripts/run_discovery.py`
  now expose `ms2_precursor_tol_da` / `--ms2-precursor-tol-da` for Da-level
  MS2 filter precursor/isolation matching. Discovery seed extraction emits
  product-plus-neutral-loss inferred precursor seeds in addition to direct
  scan-precursor neutral-loss seeds. Discovery `candidate_id` now keeps the
  `sample#scan` anchor but appends precursor/product row identity, preventing
  same-scan candidate collisions. Discovery `tag_evidence_json` records
  `precursor_mz_basis`, `scan_precursor_mz`, and scan-precursor delta fields.
  CSV column schemas are unchanged.
- Evidence: focused tests cover inferred monoisotopic seed recovery, direct and
  inferred same-scan coexistence, old out-of-tolerance rejection behavior,
  public CLI/preset plumbing, and same-scan candidate ID uniqueness. Single RAW
  validation under
  `docs/superpowers/validation/discovery_precursor_inference_v1/` reran only
  `TumorBC2312_DNA.raw` over 22-25 min and observed
  `duplicate_candidate_ids=0`, emitted `300.161 / 184.113` rows with
  `precursor_mz_basis=product_plus_neutral_loss`, and retained the valid
  `301.165 / 185.116` dR-tag row.
- Validation:
  `uv run pytest tests/test_discovery_ms2_seeds.py tests/test_discovery_grouping.py tests/test_discovery_csv.py tests/test_discovery_pipeline.py tests/test_run_discovery.py tests/test_presets_apply.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `92`; focused ruff over the touched discovery/CLI/preset/tests passed.
  The one-RAW command in
  `docs/superpowers/validation/discovery_precursor_inference_v1/README.md`
  exited `0`.
- Remaining blocker: the existing activated default `quant_matrix.tsv` has not
  been regenerated and still reflects pre-fix discovery artifacts. A later
  explicit discovery/alignment/default-activation expected-diff rerun is needed
  before claiming the released default matrix contains the `300.1605` target
  row.

### 2026-06-19 - superpowers_fixture_retention_cleanup_v1

- Lane: repo hygiene / `docs/superpowers/fixtures` retention policy.
- Previous tier: unchanged. Fixture files mixed active contracts, manual
  oracles, ledger snapshots, dated diagnostic packets, and historical scratch
  without a single inventory/hash policy.
- New tier: unchanged. No product maturity tier, active lane, ProductWriter
  authority, matrix authority, workbook behavior, GUI behavior, selected
  peak/area, counted detection, default extraction, or broad Backfill status
  changed.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/fixtures/RETENTION.md` now defines the fixture
  retention decisions; `docs/superpowers/fixtures/ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.tsv`
  inventories 28 retained fixture files, excluding the inventory itself to
  avoid self-hash churn. The inventory currently records 4 `keep_contract`,
  3 `keep_manual_oracle`, 1 `keep_manifest`, 12 `keep_ledger_snapshot`,
  3 `keep_summary`, 1 `needs_human_review`, and 4 `archive_later` rows.
  `docs/superpowers/fixtures/diagnostic_ledger_2026_05_28/README.md` captures
  duplicate snapshot groups and historical hash-drift observations without
  rewriting ledger conclusions.
- Product surface changed: docs/fixture-retention metadata only. Active fixture
  paths remain stable, and no writer/output/schema/matrix authority changed.
- Validation: closeout checks passed:
  `uv run python scripts/check_superpowers_fixture_retention.py`
  (`28` files, `1` `needs_human_review`, `4` `archive_later`);
  `uv run pytest tests/test_superpowers_fixture_retention.py -v --tb=short`;
  fixture consumer shard
  `uv run pytest tests/test_shared_peak_identity_oracle.py tests/test_shared_peak_identity_classifier.py tests/test_shared_peak_identity_assembler.py tests/test_shared_peak_identity_schema.py tests/test_alignment_tsv_writer.py -v --tb=short`
  (`59 passed`); and scoped `ruff check` for the fixture retention checker and
  tests. Focused checker tests now include `keep_summary` missing-file rejection
  and strict/non-strict `needs_human_review` behavior.
- Remaining blocker: resolve
  `docs/superpowers/fixtures/chrom_peak_segment_presence_review_manual_oracle_v1.tsv`
  as either an active manual oracle with consumer coverage or an archived
  note-only oracle.

### 2026-06-19 - validation_artifact_retention_cleanup_v1

- Lane: repo hygiene / `docs/superpowers/validation` retention policy.
- Previous tier: unchanged. Validation artifacts included rendered review HTML
  pages and PNG plots in git, which made branch diffs look like product/code
  changes even when they were generated review outputs.
- New tier: unchanged. No product maturity tier, active lane, ProductWriter
  authority, matrix authority, workbook behavior, GUI behavior, selected
  peak/area, counted detection, default extraction, or broad Backfill status
  changed.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/validation/RETENTION.md` now defines retention
  decisions; `docs/superpowers/validation/ARTIFACT_INVENTORY.tsv` inventories
  304 validation rows: 126 `keep_contract`, 39 `keep_summary`,
  4 `keep_minimal_fixture`, and 135 `externalize`.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_static_review_v1/README.md` preserves
  the static-review regeneration/use path.
  `scripts/check_validation_artifact_retention.py` and
  `tests/test_validation_artifact_retention.py` now enforce inventory coverage,
  rendered-artifact externalization, stale rendered-path replacement mapping,
  externalized-local verification, explicit `shrink_later` reporting, and
  `keep_minimal_fixture` retention for small synthetic readiness fixtures.
  The completed cleanup wave externalized 135 generated validation artifacts
  from git to ignored local storage under
  `local_validation_artifacts/externalized_superpowers_validation/`, while
  keeping contract indexes, source hashes, status indexes, summaries, minimal
  fixtures, and checker inputs in git.
- Product surface changed: docs/artifact retention only. Rendered Lockbox
  review HTML/PNG outputs are no longer version-controlled by default; clean
  checkout contract artifacts, status indexes, source summaries, and checker
  inputs remain tracked. QuantMatrix review HTML and duplicated promotion-packet
  downstream input copies are likewise externalized with tracked summary/hash
  bindings. Full QuantMatrix `cell_provenance.tsv` and
  `quant_matrix_review_rows.tsv` dumps now have tracked summary JSON plus
  minimal-fixture replacements for clean-checkout validation. Matrix values,
  ProductWriter defaults, selected peak/area, counted detection, workbook/GUI
  behavior, Backfill authority, and product outputs are unchanged.
  Review/replay validation is stricter: check-only paths now rerun temporary
  QuantMatrix activation and compare fresh `cell_provenance.tsv` hashes against
  tracked summary `source_sha256` values before accepting externalized full
  TSVs.
- Validation: closeout checks passed:
  `uv run python scripts/check_validation_artifact_retention.py --strict --require-externalized-local`
  (`169` retained validation files, `135` externalized, `0` `shrink_later`);
  `uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`;
  `uv run python scripts/build_quant_matrix_real_bundle.py --check-only`;
  `uv run python scripts/build_quant_matrix_promotion_packet_v2.py --check-only`;
  `uv run python scripts/build_quant_matrix_default_activation_dry_run.py --check-only`;
  `uv run python scripts/build_quant_matrix_product_ready_closeout.py --check-only`;
  `uv run python scripts/build_quant_matrix_default_product_activation.py --check-only`;
  focused QuantMatrix replay/retention pytest shard (`49 passed`);
  focused validation + fixture retention checker pytest shard (`21 passed`);
  scoped `ruff check` for changed scripts/modules/tests; and
  `uv run mypy xic_extractor`.
  Focused follow-up checks also passed:
  `uv run python scripts/check_validation_artifact_retention.py --strict --require-externalized-local`;
  `uv run pytest tests/test_validation_artifact_retention.py -v --tb=short`
  (`10 passed`); and scoped `ruff check` for the validation retention checker
  and tests. Earlier closeout checks also passed:
  `uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`;
  `uv run python scripts/check_lockbox_label_schema.py`;
  `uv run pytest tests/test_validation_artifact_retention.py tests/test_lockbox_label_collection_pack.py tests/test_productization_state_index.py -v --tb=short`
  (`53 passed`); `.codex/hooks/fixtures/assert_hook_outputs.py`; hook
  `py_compile`; local externalized-artifact existence check (`128/128`, no
  missing replacements); credential/local-path scan with only wording false
  positives; and `git diff --check` with LF/CRLF warnings only.
- Remaining blocker: none for `shrink_later`; validation now has zero
  `shrink_later` rows. Future generated validation outputs should stay outside
  git unless they are contract/index/hash/summary or minimal-fixture files.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Product Ready Closeout v1

- Lane: Backfill default QuantMatrix Product Ready candidate closeout /
  Phase 10.
- Previous tier: Phase 9 default activation dry-run gate passed, but Product
  Ready closeout had not yet collected Phase 8 packet readiness and Phase 9
  activation replay into one explicit activation contract.
- New tier: `product_ready_default_matrix_candidate`. This means the current
  511-cell default QuantMatrix candidate is ready for a separate explicit
  ProductWriter activation commit. It is not itself ProductWriter activation,
  default matrix output writing, or expanded matrix authority.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_product_ready_closeout_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_product_ready_closeout.py`,
  `tests/test_quant_matrix_product_ready_closeout.py`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/quant_matrix_product_ready_closeout_v1/`.
- Product surface changed: additive Phase 10 closeout outputs only:
  `quant_matrix_product_ready_closeout_summary.json` and
  `quant_matrix_product_ready_closeout_checks.tsv`.
- Evidence: default `--check-only` fail-closes to
  `source_run_id=seed-guard-realdata-85raw-generated-policy-policy-observed-oracle-20260617`,
  `downstream_scope=current_511_authority_replay`, and
  `accepted_backfill_count=511`. The checker revalidates Phase 8 promotion
  packet v2 and Phase 9 default activation dry-run, checks their source hashes,
  and rebuilds the closeout checklist from those inputs.
- Current validation result: closeout status is `pass`; checklist rows
  `promotion_packet_v2_validated`, `science_evidence_complete`,
  `default_activation_dry_run_passed`, `expected_diff_closed`,
  `authority_unchanged`, and `product_ready_candidate_closeout` all pass. The
  summary records `product_ready_candidate=true`,
  `default_quant_matrix_product_ready_candidate=true`,
  `may_activate_default_quant_matrix_with_explicit_contract=true`,
  `requires_product_writer_activation_commit=true`,
  `explicit_activation_not_in_this_commit=true`, `write_authority=false`, and
  `default_matrix_files_written=false`.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, default
  matrix files, workbook, GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted detection,
  review/replay behavior, current 511-cell writer authority, or broad Backfill
  authority changed.
- Status-index update: not needed for Phase 10 because no active lane authority,
  writer scope, row count, or output-changing flag changed. The status-index
  writer row remains the current 511-cell Backfill scope only.
- Next checkpoint: explicit ProductWriter activation commit, if/when requested,
  with expected-diff output tests and public-surface review.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Default Activation Dry-Run v1

- Lane: Backfill default matrix activation dry-run / Phase 9.
- Previous tier: Phase 8 produced a `production_ready_candidate_packet`, but no
  gate had replayed the actual manifest-driven default matrix activation path
  against the Phase 7 real bundle expected diff.
- New tier: default activation dry-run gate pass. This permits Phase 10 Product
  Ready closeout review to proceed, but it is still a no-RAW, read-only
  validation artifact: no ProductWriter default extraction, default matrix
  output, selected peak/area/counting behavior, workbook/GUI behavior,
  review/replay behavior, broad Backfill unpark, or new matrix write changed.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_default_activation_dry_run_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_default_activation_dry_run.py`,
  `tests/test_quant_matrix_default_activation_dry_run.py`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/quant_matrix_default_activation_dry_run_v1/`.
- Product surface changed: additive Phase 9 dry-run outputs only:
  `quant_matrix_default_activation_dry_run_summary.json` and
  `default_activation_dry_run_comparison.tsv`. The dry-run activation writes
  temporary outputs only during build/check and commits no duplicate full matrix
  outputs.
- Evidence: default `--check-only` fail-closes to
  `source_run_id=seed-guard-realdata-85raw-generated-policy-policy-observed-oracle-20260617`,
  `downstream_scope=current_511_authority_replay`, and
  `accepted_backfill_count=511`. Focused tests cover schema parity, candidate
  expected-diff replay, stale comparison rejection, non-current 511 bundle
  rejection, and CLI round trip.
- Current validation result: default activation dry-run gate is `pass`; the
  Phase 9 rerun writes `511` expected Backfill rows, `511` accepted Backfill
  cells, and `0` unused expected-diff rows in temporary output. The rerun's
  `quant_matrix`, `cell_provenance`, `row_summary`, and
  `expected_diff_summary` hashes match the Phase 7 reference bundle exactly.
  The summary records `dry_run_only=true`, `write_authority=false`,
  `default_quant_matrix_changed=false`, and
  `default_matrix_files_written=false`.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, default
  matrix files, workbook, GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted detection,
  review/replay behavior, current 511-cell writer authority, or broad Backfill
  authority changed.
- Remaining blocker: Product Ready still needs Phase 10 closeout to collect the
  Phase 8/9 gates, review residual risk, and state the activation contract.
- Next checkpoint: Phase 10 Product Ready closeout gate.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Promotion Packet v2

- Lane: Backfill promotion evidence packet / Phase 8.
- Previous tier: Phase 7 produced a real 511-cell `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle
  with downstream-impact smoke, but readiness was still
  `contract_ready_science_inconclusive` because the real downstream artifact had
  not been rebound with the existing large-cohort and heldout-oracle evidence.
- New tier: `production_ready_candidate_packet` for the packet/readiness gate
  only. This is not ProductWriter default extraction, default matrix authority,
  selected peak/area/counting behavior, workbook/GUI behavior, review/replay
  behavior change, broad Backfill unpark, or a new matrix write.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_promotion_packet_v2_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_promotion_packet_v2.py`,
  `tests/test_quant_matrix_promotion_packet_v2.py`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/quant_matrix_promotion_validation_packet_v2/`.
- Product surface changed: additive Phase 8 promotion packet outputs only:
  `quant_matrix_promotion_packet_v2_summary.json`,
  `quant_matrix_validation_evidence_v1.json`,
  `quant_matrix_validation_evidence_rows.tsv`,
  `quant_matrix_validation_evidence_summary.json`, copied `artifacts/*`, and
  `real_bundle_readiness/`. The packet copies the downstream-impact smoke bundle
  plus packet-local downstream input TSVs so content validation can rerun
  without trusting tier strings alone.
- Evidence: default `--check-only` fail-closes to
  `source_run_id=seed-guard-realdata-85raw-generated-policy-policy-observed-oracle-20260617`,
  `downstream_scope=current_511_authority_replay`, and
  `accepted_backfill_count=511`. Focused tests cover schema parity, real-bundle
  candidate readiness, stale real-bundle readiness rejection, non-current 511
  bundle rejection, and CLI round trip.
- Current validation result: large-cohort, heldout-oracle, and real
  downstream-impact evidence all pass. Real-bundle readiness is
  `production_ready_candidate_packet`, `contract_correctness_status=pass`,
  `scientific_confidence_status=pass`, `production_ready=true`, and
  `may_promote_default_quant_matrix=true`.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, default
  matrix authority, workbook, GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted
  detection, review/replay behavior, current 511-cell writer authority, or
  broad Backfill authority changed.
- Remaining blocker: default matrix activation still needs a Phase 9 dry-run
  expected-diff gate before any public writer/default behavior changes.
- Next checkpoint: Phase 9 default-matrix activation dry-run expected-diff gate.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Real Bundle v1

- Lane: Backfill real `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle assembly / Phase 7.
- Previous tier: Phase 6 defined a downstream-impact smoke contract, but the
  durable productization packet still did not include a real
  `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle produced from the current 511-cell authority
  replay.
- New tier: unchanged. This is a no-RAW, read-only real-bundle builder/checker
  and validation artifact, not a maturity-tier promotion, ProductWriter default
  extraction change, selected peak/area/counting change, workbook/GUI change,
  review/replay behavior change, broad Backfill unpark, or new matrix
  authority.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_real_bundle_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_real_bundle.py`,
  `tests/test_quant_matrix_real_bundle.py`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/quant_matrix_real_bundle_v1/`.
- Product surface changed: additive Phase 7 bundle outputs only. The bundle
  contains a `ProductionAcceptanceManifest`, expected diff,
  `QuantMatrixVersion`, cell provenance, row summary, review summary/report,
  downstream-impact smoke, and contract-only readiness sidecars generated from
  the current source run
  `seed-guard-realdata-85raw-generated-policy-policy-observed-oracle-20260617`.
- Evidence: default `--check-only` now fail-closes to
  `source_run_id=seed-guard-realdata-85raw-generated-policy-policy-observed-oracle-20260617`,
  `downstream_scope=current_511_authority_replay`, and
  `accepted_backfill_count=511`; synthetic/partial bundles require explicit
  test overrides and cannot satisfy the default Phase 7 check. Focused tests
  cover schema parity, self-validation, source-copy tamper rejection,
  non-current 511 bundle rejection, downstream rows deletion rejection, and CLI
  round trip.
- Current validation result: the real bundle check passes, contract correctness
  passes, downstream-impact smoke passes, and readiness remains
  `contract_ready_science_inconclusive` with `production_ready=false` and
  `may_promote_default_quant_matrix=false` before Phase 8 evidence binding.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, default
  matrix authority, workbook, GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted
  detection, review/replay behavior, current 511-cell writer authority, or
  broad Backfill authority changed.
- Remaining blocker: historical for Phase 7. Phase 8 now binds the real
  downstream-impact artifact into promotion packet v2; default matrix activation
  still requires a later expected-diff gate.
- Next checkpoint: historical. Use `QuantMatrix Promotion Packet v2` above for
  the current promotion candidate packet.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Downstream Impact Smoke v1

- Lane: Backfill downstream-impact evidence contract / Phase 6.
- Previous tier: `QuantMatrix Promotion Validation Packet v1` required
  downstream-impact evidence, but the tier could only bind artifact relpath,
  hash, and `downstream_scope`; it did not define the artifact content needed to
  distinguish a real `QuantMatrixVersion` downstream smoke from a contract
  fixture or arbitrary tier string.
- New tier: unchanged. This is a no-RAW, read-only downstream-impact contract
  and checker/builder surface, not a maturity-tier promotion, ProductWriter
  default extraction, selected peak/area/counting change, workbook/GUI change,
  or new matrix authority.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_downstream_impact_smoke_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_downstream_impact_smoke.py`, and
  `xic_extractor/alignment/quant_matrix_downstream_impact.py`.
- Product surface changed: additive downstream-impact smoke outputs only:
  `quant_matrix_downstream_impact_smoke.json` and
  `quant_matrix_downstream_impact_rows.tsv`. The existing validation packet and
  promotion readiness check now content-validate the
  `downstream_impact_smoke` artifact instead of trusting a tier string alone.
  Validation packets copy the downstream smoke bundle as summary plus rows TSV.
- Evidence: focused tests cover schema parity, real-bundle pass behavior,
  contract-fixture no-promotion behavior, row-metrics hash drift rejection,
  input-artifact hash drift rejection, recomputed row/metric mismatch rejection,
  script `--check-only` round trip, promotion-readiness science-ready fixture
  content validation, validation-packet rejection of downstream contract
  fixtures, and validation-packet acceptance of real downstream bundles.
- Current validation result: Phase 6 contract tests pass, but the current
  durable promotion packet still remains `contract_ready_science_inconclusive`
  until a real downstream-impact artifact is generated from a real
  `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle and rebound into the packet.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, workbook,
  GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted detection, review/replay behavior,
  current 511-cell writer authority, or broad Backfill authority changed.
- Remaining blocker: production-ready promotion still needs a real
  `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle plus downstream-impact smoke generated from that
  bundle. Contract fixtures cannot satisfy promotion.
- Next checkpoint: assemble the real `QuantMatrixVersion` bundle and run the
  downstream-impact smoke against it before building a promotion packet v2.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Promotion Validation Packet v1

- Lane: Backfill validation/promotion evidence packet / Phase 5 follow-up.
- Previous tier: `QuantMatrix Promotion Readiness v1` could parse validation
  evidence rows, but no durable packet existed to bind source artifacts, copied
  packet artifacts, hashes, and science-evidence gaps.
- New tier: unchanged. This is a no-RAW, read-only validation evidence packet
  and checker/builder surface, not a maturity-tier promotion, ProductWriter
  default extraction, or new matrix authority.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_validation_evidence_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_promotion_validation_packet.py`,
  `xic_extractor/alignment/quant_matrix_validation_packet.py`, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/quant_matrix_promotion_validation_packet_v1/`.
- Product surface changed: additive validation packet outputs only:
  `quant_matrix_validation_evidence_v1.json`,
  `quant_matrix_validation_evidence_rows.tsv`,
  `quant_matrix_validation_evidence_summary.json`, copied `artifacts/*`, and a
  labeled readiness integration fixture under
  `readiness_integration_fixture/`.
- Evidence: the packet copies and hash-binds the existing no-RAW 85RAW
  consolidated standard-peak activation input summary and the 20-case heldout
  trace reintegration oracle smoke summary. Focused tests cover schema parity,
  source/copy hash recording, copied-artifact hash drift rejection, authority
  drift rejection, source-root binding, Phase 5 checker integration, rows/summary
  drift rejection, readiness fixture rerun, and CLI `--check-only` round trip.
- Current validation result: large-cohort evidence is `pass`,
  heldout-oracle evidence is `pass`, downstream-impact evidence is `missing`.
  The readiness integration fixture is `contract_ready_science_inconclusive`,
  `production_ready=false`, and `may_promote_default_quant_matrix=false`.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, workbook,
  GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted detection, review/replay behavior,
  current 511-cell writer authority, or broad Backfill authority changed.
- Remaining blocker: production-ready promotion still needs a real
  downstream-impact smoke artifact and a real `QuantMatrixVersion` contract
  bundle. Do not treat this packet as `production_ready`.
- Next checkpoint: define and validate the downstream-impact evidence source
  for accepted Backfill values; do not revive scoring or broad Backfill as the
  promotion path.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrix Promotion Readiness v1

- Lane: Backfill validation/promotion readiness / Phase 5.
- Previous tier: Phase 4 `QuantMatrixVersion Review Report v1` provided a
  review-only surface but did not define when contract correctness can be
  separated from scientific production readiness.
- New tier: unchanged. This is a read-only readiness checker and public output
  schema, not a maturity-tier promotion, ProductWriter default extraction, or
  new matrix authority.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_promotion_readiness_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/check_quant_matrix_promotion_readiness.py`, and
  `xic_extractor/alignment/quant_matrix_promotion.py`.
- Product surface changed: additive readiness sidecars only:
  `quant_matrix_promotion_readiness_summary.json` and
  `quant_matrix_promotion_readiness_checks.tsv`.
- Evidence: focused tests cover schema-column parity, contract-ready but
  science-inconclusive behavior, focused-test/8RAW-only no-promotion guard,
  unbound tier/status-string no-promotion guard, duplicate validation tier
  fail-closed behavior, artifact-bound synthetic large-cohort + oracle +
  downstream pass behavior, invalid accepted-cell hash format, contract-failure
  dominance, script entrypoint, and `--require-production-ready` nonzero exit
  when science evidence is missing.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, workbook,
  GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted detection, review/replay behavior,
  current 511-cell writer authority, or broad Backfill authority changed.
- Production-ready claim: the focused tests prove the gate behavior only.
  Current status is contract-ready/science-inconclusive unless a later explicit
  validation packet supplies artifact-bound passing large-cohort,
  heldout-oracle or manual review, and downstream-impact evidence.
- Remaining blocker: actual promotion still needs a named validation tier and
  evidence packet with downstream-impact evidence. Do not run RAW/85RAW unless
  an active goal names that tier.
- Next checkpoint: current evidence packet is represented by
  `QuantMatrix Promotion Validation Packet v1` above.

### 2026-06-19 - Discovery row-identity/evidence contract gate v1

- Lane: Discovery row identity and evidence contract / default-output unblocker.
- Previous tier: default QuantMatrix activation existed for the current
  511-cell Backfill authority, but user review found that the activated bundle
  predates a missing `300.1605 -> 184.113` Discovery row. The nearby
  `301.165 -> 185.116` isotope feature row is valid and must not be deleted or
  bridged into target authority.
- New tier: unchanged. This is a Discovery contract/gate hardening and
  one-RAW validation artifact; it does not regenerate the default matrix,
  change active lane, or grant new matrix/Backfill/ProductWriter authority.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-untargeted-discovery-v1-spec.md`
  now defines direct scan-precursor and product-plus-neutral-loss inferred
  seed bases; `discovery_candidates.csv` carries
  `neutral_loss_error_basis`, `precursor_mz_basis`, `scan_precursor_mz`,
  `scan_precursor_delta_da`, and `max_scan_precursor_abs_delta_da`; alignment
  CSV replay rejects stale `sample#scan` candidate ids, mismatched
  candidate-id suffixes, duplicate candidate ids, and invalid basis enums.
  The one-RAW validation artifact under
  `docs/superpowers/validation/discovery_precursor_inference_v1/` emits both
  inferred `300.1605 / 184.113` and valid `301.165 / 185.116` rows with
  duplicate candidate ids equal to 0.
- Product surface changed: Discovery full-candidate TSV schema and alignment
  replay behavior changed fail-closed for stale candidate ids. ProductWriter,
  matrix contents, workbook, GUI, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  scorer, 85RAW validation, current 511-cell writer authority, and broad
  Backfill authority did not change.
- Validation: focused Discovery/CSV/alignment tests, one-RAW
  `scripts/run_discovery.py` over `TumorBC2312_DNA.raw` in the 22-25 min
  window, and
  `scripts/check_discovery_precursor_inference_artifact.py --check-only`
  passed. The candidate artifact SHA-256 is
  `B1B4956C3F0296D51E144659DB127CFB453140A66030C97C22FEED8C11326E2B`.
- Remaining blocker: the activated default `quant_matrix.tsv` still predates
  this Discovery fix. Claiming `300.1605` target-row presence requires a later
  explicit discovery/alignment/default-activation expected-diff rerun.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrixVersion Review Report v1

- Lane: Backfill gallery/report alignment / Phase 4.
- Previous tier: Phase 3 `QuantMatrixVersion Activation v1` produced explicit
  quant/provenance/row/source sidecars but did not provide a user-facing review
  surface.
- New tier: unchanged. This is a review-only report adapter and public output
  schema, not a maturity-tier promotion, ProductWriter default extraction, or
  new matrix authority.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_review_report_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_version_report.py`, and
  `xic_extractor/alignment/quant_matrix_report.py`.
- Product surface changed: additive review outputs only:
  `quant_matrix_review_rows.tsv`, `quant_matrix_review_summary.json`, and
  `quant_matrix_review_report.html`.
- Evidence: focused tests cover schema-column parity, review row rendering for
  detected plus accepted Backfill cells, summary counts, manifest enrichment,
  source-summary manifest file-hash drift, hash/authority-bound manifest joins,
  fail-closed missing manifest join, HTML escaping, and script entrypoint.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, workbook,
  GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted detection, review/replay behavior,
  current 511-cell writer authority, or broad Backfill authority changed.
- Remaining blocker: none for the review-only report adapter itself. Phase 5
  readiness separation is represented by `QuantMatrix Promotion Readiness v1`
  above.
- Next checkpoint: historical. Use the Phase 5 readiness checker above before
  any promotion packet.

### 2026-06-19 - QuantMatrixVersion Activation v1

- Lane: Backfill quant-matrix activation / Phase 3.
- Previous tier: Phase 2 `ProductionAcceptanceManifest v1` schema/checker was
  an authority precursor and did not write matrix outputs.
- New tier: unchanged. This is an explicit activation adapter and public output
  schema for manifest-authorized Backfill values, not a maturity-tier
  promotion and not ProductWriter default extraction.
- Current artifacts:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/quant_matrix_version_schema.v1.json`,
  `scripts/build_quant_matrix_version.py`, and
  `xic_extractor/alignment/quant_matrix_version.py`.
- Product surface changed: additive explicit outputs only:
  `quant_matrix.tsv`, `cell_provenance.tsv`, `row_summary.tsv`,
  `expected_diff_summary.tsv`, and `source_summary.tsv`.
- Evidence: focused tests cover writing detected plus accepted Backfill values
  from a validated `ProductionAcceptanceManifest`, expected-diff enforcement,
  provenance completeness, row summary counts, detected-only view is reconstructable
  from `quant_matrix + cell_provenance`, missing expected-diff
  rejection, and detected-value overwrite rejection.
- Product surface not changed: No ProductWriter default extraction, workbook,
  GUI, selected peak, selected area, counted detection, review/replay behavior,
  current 511-cell writer authority, or broad Backfill authority changed.
- Remaining blocker: validation/promotion readiness still needs a separate
  Phase 5 gate before any production-readiness claim.
- Next checkpoint: Phase 4 Gallery/Report Alignment was the next phase from
  this checkpoint and is now represented by
  `QuantMatrixVersion Review Report v1` above.

### 2026-06-19 - ProductionAcceptanceManifest v1 schema/checker

- Lane: Backfill quant-matrix authority contract / Phase 2.
- Previous tier: Phase 1 lockbox shadow adapter was
  `shadow_only=true`, `write_authority=false`, and allowed only
  `define_production_acceptance_manifest_v1`.
- New tier: unchanged. This is an additive contract/checker surface and a
  precursor to Phase 3 activation, not ProductWriter authority and not a
  maturity-tier promotion.
- Current artifact:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/production_acceptance_manifest_schema.v1.json`.
  It defines `ProductionAcceptanceManifest v1`, where the authority key is
  `peak_hypothesis_id + sample_stem`; `feature_family_id is context/provenance only`.
- Evidence: `scripts/check_production_acceptance_manifest.py` validates the
  schema and any candidate manifest TSV. The checker enforces acceptance
  vocabulary, source/doublet artifact path containment, existence, and
  file-hash match, source row hash and canonical manifest sha, finite
  non-negative accepted quant values, Backfill-fraction consistency,
  manual-negative hard stop, blocked doublet hard stop, authority-lane
  contradictions, primary-key uniqueness, report-only prevalence risks, and
  strict risk-specific closure.
- Product surface changed: additive schema JSON, checker script, focused tests,
  control-plane section, and handoff only. No ProductWriter, matrix, workbook,
  selected peak/area, counted detection, workbook schema, CLI/config,
  extraction default, GUI, broad Backfill, or truth-label behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_production_acceptance_manifest.py`
  returned `ProductionAcceptanceManifest schema is valid.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_production_acceptance_manifest_contract.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `16`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_productization_state_index.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `13`.
- Remaining blocker: this checker can validate write-authority rows, but it does
  not write the default matrix. Any matrix behavior still requires Phase 3
  QuantMatrixVersion Activation with expected-diff, `cell_provenance`, and
  focused output tests.
- Next checkpoint: Phase 3 QuantMatrixVersion Activation, not default matrix
  activation from a shadow/report/gallery/candidate artifact.

### 2026-06-19 - lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / `peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1`.
- Previous tier: unchanged `production_candidate` single-owner + AI-challenge
  gate. That packet allowed only a later shadow automation experiment design.
- New tier: unchanged `production_candidate`. Current active artifact is
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_v1.json`
  with `decision=shadow_scoring_contract_adapter_v1_ready` and
  `allowed_next_step=define_production_acceptance_manifest_v1`.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_design.py`
  consumes `lockbox_next_action_plan_v1.tsv`,
  `lockbox_next_action_summary_v1.json`, and
  `lockbox_single_owner_ai_challenge_gate_v1.json`, then writes a 72-row shadow
  contract manifest. It routes 53 owner-clean Gaussian15 cases as
  non-authoritative accept challenges, 6 existing manual wrong-peak/no-peak
  controls as reject hard stops, and 13 excluded rows as `not_scored`. It
  records the Gaussian15 boundary policy, shadow/truth/doublet enums, row-level
  doublet fields, source paths/hashes, manifest sha, `shadow_only=true`,
  `write_authority=false`, `matrix_write_allowed=false`,
  `may_satisfy_reviewer_slot2=false`, and
  `single_owner_evidence_is_truth_completion=false`.
- Product surface changed: validation decision JSON, case-manifest TSV, helper
  script, focused tests, status index, label README, control plane, and handoff
  only. No ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted
  detection, workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, GUI, broad
  Backfill, or truth-label behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_design.py`
  built the design packet;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_design.py --check-only`
  returned `Lockbox shadow automation experiment design is valid.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_design.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `14`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check scripts/build_lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_design.py tests/test_lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_design.py tests/test_productization_state_index.py`
  passed;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`
  returned `Productization state index is consistent and fail-closed.`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_productization_state_index.py tests/test_lockbox_shadow_automation_experiment_design.py -v --tb=short`
  passed `25`.
- Remaining blocker: this adapter cannot grant writer authority. Phase 2 now
  defines the separate `ProductionAcceptanceManifest v1` schema/checker; any
  ProductWriter authority expansion still needs Phase 3 QuantMatrixVersion
  Activation with expected-diff and focused output tests.
- Next checkpoint: Phase 3 QuantMatrixVersion Activation. Do not promote shadow
  results to writer authority.

### 2026-06-18 - productization_status_index_v1

- Lane: Productization control-plane cleanup / machine-checkable lane status.
- Previous tier: the handoff and control plane contained current lane status in
  prose, but there was no compact machine-readable index that could reject
  authority drift.
- New tier: `production_candidate` control-plane guard. This does not change
  product behavior or writer authority.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/productization_control_plane_schema.v1.json`
  defines the status-index schema and allowed readiness states.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/productization_status_index_v1.tsv` records each
  current lane exactly once, including parked broad Backfill, the 511-cell
  current writer scope, review/truth/recovery assets, targeted MS1 limited
  rescue, sample metadata no-output projection, ReviewAction parked writebacks,
  calibration freeze, and GUI out-of-scope state.
  `scripts/check_productization_state.py` validates lane uniqueness, required
  lanes, artifact hashes, doc anchors, authority-manifest alignment, and that
  parked/blocked/diagnostic/frozen/out-of-scope/review/truth/evidence lanes
  cannot write.
- Product surface changed: docs/spec/validation/test/helper script only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, or GUI behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`
  returned `Productization state index is consistent and fail-closed.` Focused
  tests passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_productization_state_index.py -v --tb=short`
  (`9 passed`). Focused ruff passed for `scripts/check_productization_state.py`
  and `tests/test_productization_state_index.py`. Subagent review findings were
  fixed by adding workbook/selected-peak/selected-area flags, rejecting
  non-writer authority scopes and product-output changes, and requiring
  handoff/control-plane anchors. Full local gate also passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run ruff check xic_extractor tests scripts/build_trace_overlay_recovery_report.py scripts/build_peak_choice_truth_lockbox.py scripts/check_productization_authority.py scripts/check_productization_state.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run mypy xic_extractor`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_authority.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_state.py`;
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest -v --tb=short -x`
  (`3813 passed, 1 skipped`);
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_diagnostics_index.py`;
  `git diff --check` passed with LF/CRLF warnings only.
- Remaining blocker: this is a guardrail, not product behavior. It does not
  collect lockbox labels, recover new RAW evidence, or promote any parked lane.
- Next checkpoint: Goal 6 bounded non-broad lane hardening. Keep the status
  index in future productization gates.

### 2026-06-18 - missing_overlay_evidence_recovery_v1

- Lane: Missing-overlay evidence recovery / low-manual review infrastructure.
- Previous tier: 1087 rows were `evidence_required` because the source audit had
  `missing_overlay_path` and no trace/overlay links.
- New tier: `production_candidate` evidence-recovery asset. The rows remain
  `evidence_required`; no writer authority changes.
- Evidence: `scripts/build_trace_overlay_recovery_report.py` links all 1087
  missing-overlay rows from `mechanical_adjudication_index_v1.tsv` to existing
  family-level trace JSON, overlay PNG, hypothesis PNG, and sample-level trace
  fields across 114 families. The generated
  `docs/superpowers/validation/trace_overlay_recovery_report_v1.tsv` records
  `recovery_status=family_trace_overlay_recovered`, `sample_trace_present=TRUE`,
  and `post_recovery_evidence_grade=C_trace_recovered` for all 1087 rows.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/missing_overlay_resolution_summary_v1.json`
  records `status=all_existing_family_trace_overlays_recovered`.
- Product surface changed: docs/spec/validation/test/helper script only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, or GUI behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_trace_overlay_recovery_report.py`
  generated the recovery report. Focused tests passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_trace_overlay_recovery_contract.py -v --tb=short`
  (`5 passed`). Focused ruff passed for
  `scripts/build_trace_overlay_recovery_report.py` and
  `tests/test_trace_overlay_recovery_contract.py`. JSON parse passed for the
  recovery schema and summary.
- Remaining blocker: recovered trace/overlay evidence is not peak-choice truth
  and not area approval. These rows need structured review, truth labels, or a
  later reintegration/expected-diff authority goal before any product write can
  be considered.
- Next checkpoint: Goal 5 productization control-plane cleanup. Do not use this
  recovery report as ProductWriter input.

### 2026-06-18 - peak_choice_truth_lockbox_v1

- Lane: Peak-choice truth acquisition / low-manual review infrastructure.
- Previous tier: Review Packet / Approval Workflow v1 made the 3015
  trace-matched unresolved rows reviewable, but there was no independent
  truth-label protocol or family-split lockbox.
- New tier: `production_candidate` for a non-mutating truth acquisition
  contract. This does not change writer authority.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/peak_choice_truth_protocol.v1.md` defines
  the truth-lockbox protocol. `docs/superpowers/specs/truth_label_schema.v1.json`
  defines the sampling manifest and label-log schema. The generated
  `docs/superpowers/validation/lockbox_sampling_manifest_v1.tsv` contains 72
  deterministic cases: 18 approved write-ready controls, 24 unresolved
  review-ready rows split across high-signal dirty / low-height / apex-delta /
  shape-width-scan contexts, 12 missing-overlay evidence-gap rows, 12 failed
  heldout-oracle negative cases, and 6 manual wrong-peak/no-peak fixtures.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/reviewer_label_log_v1.tsv` is intentionally
  header-only, and
  `docs/superpowers/validation/inter_reviewer_agreement_summary_v1.json`
  records `status=no_labels_collected`. Missing-overlay evidence-gap rows are
  not forced into fake area labels: they have `area_label_required=FALSE`, and
  all rows allow `not_assessed` / `unavailable`.
- Product surface changed: docs/spec/validation/test/helper script only. No
  ProductWriter, matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection,
  workbook schema, CLI/config, extraction default, or GUI behavior changed.
- Validation:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/build_peak_choice_truth_lockbox.py`
  generated the 72-case lockbox. Focused tests passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_peak_choice_truth_lockbox_contract.py -v --tb=short`
  (`6 passed`). Focused ruff passed for
  `scripts/build_peak_choice_truth_lockbox.py` and
  `tests/test_peak_choice_truth_lockbox_contract.py`. JSON parse passed for the
  truth schema and agreement summary. Subagent review found one P2 issue where
  missing-overlay rows could be forced into area labels; the generated manifest
  and tests now require honest `not_assessed` / `unavailable` handling.
- Remaining blocker: no reviewer labels or agreement metrics exist yet; lockbox
  membership and future labels cannot grant ProductWriter authority without a
  later authority manifest plus expected-diff goal.
- Next checkpoint: Goal 4 missing-overlay evidence recovery. Do not make the
  1087 missing-overlay rows writable simply because they are sampled here.

### 2026-06-18 - productization_review_packet_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority control plane /
  low-manual review workflow.
- Previous tier: Goal 0/1 authority/adjudication contract existed as a
  `production_candidate` control asset, but unresolved rows had no structured
  human approval packet.
- New tier: `production_candidate` for Review Packet / Approval Workflow v1 as
  a non-mutating review contract. This does not change writer authority.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/review_packet_schema.v1.json` defines
  packet/log schemas and forbids free-form value entry, matrix touch, and
  product authority from review approval.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/review_queue_v1.tsv` contains 3015
  trace-matched unresolved rows as `review_ready`; each row has candidate value,
  area/height/RT fields, trace JSON path, overlay PNG path, one review question,
  and allowed actions
  `approve_candidate;reject_candidate;escalate_unresolved`.
  `docs/superpowers/validation/review_decision_log_v1.tsv` is a structured
  header-only decision log template. The 1087 missing-overlay rows are not in
  this review queue and remain Goal 4 evidence-recovery work.
- Product surface changed: docs/spec/validation/test only. No ProductWriter,
  matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection, workbook schema,
  CLI/config, extraction default, or GUI behavior changed.
- Validation: focused checkpoint shard passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_review_packet_contract.py tests/test_check_productization_authority.py tests/test_productization_authority_mechanical_adjudication.py -v --tb=short`
  (`12 passed`); focused ruff passed for the checker/tests; authority checker
  passed; review packet schema JSON parse passed. Full local gate passed:
  `ruff check xic_extractor tests`, `mypy xic_extractor`,
  `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3792 passed, 1 skipped`), and
  `scripts/check_diagnostics_index.py`.
- Remaining blocker: this checkpoint does not implement truth labels, review UI,
  ProductWriter integration, or trace overlay recovery.
- Next checkpoint: after review/commit, proceed to Peak-Choice Truth Set /
  Lockbox v1. Do not treat review approval as ProductWriter authority.

### 2026-06-18 - productization_authority_checker_v1

- Lane: Productization authority firewall / Goal 0-1 hardening.
- Previous tier: `productization_authority_manifest_v1` and
  `mechanical_adjudication_index_v1` were `production_candidate` control
  assets validated by focused pytest only.
- New tier: unchanged, but the authority firewall now has a reusable checker
  entry point.
- Evidence: `scripts/check_productization_authority.py` validates the manifest,
  mechanical adjudication schema, and 4613-row index. It checks fail-closed
  unregistered scope behavior, the 511/4102 authority split, 3015/1087 evidence
  classes, parked broad Backfill, negative-evidence scopes, explanation-only
  sources, and source hashes. `tests/test_check_productization_authority.py`
  adds a forbidden-scope regression test by mutating a non-write row to
  `all_stability`.
- Product surface changed: checker/test only. It does not modify or call
  ProductWriter.
- Validation: focused checker tests passed and
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run python scripts/check_productization_authority.py`
  returned `Productization authority contract is fail-closed.` Full local gate
  passed with the review-packet checkpoint.
- Remaining blocker: none for the current non-mutating checker contract; it must
  be kept in future productization authority gates.
- Next checkpoint: keep this checker in the PR/local gate set for future
  productization authority changes.

### 2026-06-18 - productization_authority_mechanical_adjudication_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority control plane /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: broad Backfill auto-write was `parked`; generated policy replay
  remained `production_ready` only for 511 current `write_ready` cells.
- New tier: unchanged for writer authority. The authority/adjudication control
  asset is `production_candidate`: it classifies the current 4613-row
  candidate/audit universe without adding ProductWriter authority.
- Evidence:
  `docs/superpowers/specs/productization_authority_manifest.v1.json` freezes
  current product authority at `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` / 511 cells
  and marks broad Backfill, quality explanations, quality blockers, and known
  negative-evidence scopes as non-authority. `docs/superpowers/specs/mechanical_adjudication_schema.v1.json`
  defines fail-closed row decisions. `docs/superpowers/validation/mechanical_adjudication_index_v1.tsv`
  classifies all 4613 rows as 511 `write_ready`, 3015 requiring independent
  peak-choice/area truth, and 1087 requiring trace/overlay or reintegration
  evidence.
- Product surface changed: docs/spec/validation/test only. No ProductWriter,
  matrix, workbook, selected peak/area, counted detection, workbook schema,
  CLI/config, extraction default, or GUI behavior changed.
- Validation: focused contract shard passed:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests/test_productization_authority_mechanical_adjudication.py -v --tb=short`
  (`5 passed`), focused ruff passed for the new test file, full ruff passed,
  mypy passed, diagnostics index passed, `git diff --check` passed with only
  LF/CRLF warnings, and full pytest passed (`3785 passed, 1 skipped`).
  Subagent review found stale broad-Backfill wording; current-summary and
  historical-log entries were fixed so broad auto-write is `parked` and future
  work routes through authority/adjudication, structured review, truth, or trace
  evidence.
- Remaining blocker: none for the authority/adjudication contract itself. This
  contract does not implement review packets, truth lockbox labels, or trace
  overlay recovery.
- Next checkpoint: run review/validation, then build structured review packets
  or peak-choice truth/lockbox assets. Do not convert the 3015 or 1087 classes
  into writer pools without a later authority manifest update plus expected-diff
  gate.

### 2026-06-18 - backfill_broad_autowrite_feasibility_gate_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: broad Backfill was on implementation hold pending one read-only
  feasibility gate; current writer authority remained 511 `write_ready` cells.
- New tier: `parked` for broad Backfill auto-write. Current 511-cell
  `production_ready` writer authority is unchanged.
- Evidence:
  `docs/superpowers/notes/backfill_broad_autowrite_feasibility_gate_v1.md`
  revalidated artifact hashes and counts, assessed ISTD reference semantics,
  compared the 3015 unresolved trace-matched rows against the 511 approved rows,
  and output exactly `park_broad_backfill`.
- Product surface changed: docs/control-plane only. No ProductWriter, matrix,
  workbook, selected area, counted detection, workbook schema, CLI/config, or
  TSV schema behavior changed.
- Validation: no-RAW artifact inspection only; no 85RAW rerun because existing
  artifacts were sufficient to decide the gate. `git diff --check` passed with
  only LF/CRLF warnings.
- Remaining blocker: broad Backfill can reopen only with a new independent
  truth source for peak-choice / family identity. `quality_blockers`,
  round-trip reintegration, all-stability, apex-delta, width-only, and
  shape-margin cannot be repackaged as a new broad writer path.
- Next checkpoint: stop broad Backfill diagnostics. Continue only existing
  511-cell release hardening or non-broad lanes unless the user approves a new
  independent truth-source proposal.

### 2026-06-18 - backfill_autowrite_ground_truth_strategy_reset_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: generated policy replay was `production_ready` for 511 current
  approved-evidence / observed-oracle rows; broad 4613-row Backfill remained
  `production_candidate`, with handoff wording still nudging the next step
  toward choosing another evidence class from blocker-token distribution.
- New tier: unchanged for writer authority. Broad Backfill expansion is on
  implementation hold until a read-only ground-truth packet is reviewed. This is
  a strategy reset, not a product behavior change.
- Evidence: reviewed the 2026-06-18 ChatGPT reset note and Backfill auto-write
  ground-truth strategy note, then recorded the blocking critique in
  `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-06-18-backfill-autowrite-ground-truth-critical-review.md`.
  Revalidated key no-RAW facts: Backfill promotes only MS1 morphology
  `primary_matrix_area`; existing replay artifacts still report 4613 policy
  rows, 511 `write_ready`, 0 `detected_flagged`, 4102 `blocked`, and 511/511
  writer expected-diff pass; targeted ISTD benchmark maps six active ISTDs to
  selected family IDs with 85/85 untargeted positives; a small matrix check over
  those six families found no `>3x median` high outliers and low-side outliers
  in every family.
- Validation: docs/no-RAW artifact inspection only; no RAW or 85RAW rerun.
  `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF warnings.
- Remaining blocker: superseded by
  `backfill_broad_autowrite_feasibility_gate_v1`, which outputs
  `park_broad_backfill`.
- Next checkpoint: do not derive a writer predicate directly from
  `quality_blockers`; do not train/approve rows from the current round-trip
  reintegration oracle alone; do not include `missing_overlay_path` rows without
  regenerated trace evidence; if the gate cannot stay simple, park broad
  Backfill instead of adding more diagnostics.

### 2026-06-17 - sample_metadata_no_output_parity_tier_closeout_v1

- Lane: `sample_metadata_cross_module_parity_v1`.
- Previous tier: `production_surface` for extraction/alignment/
  RT-normalization injection-order parity and instrument-QC sidecar projection;
  `production_candidate` wording for roles.
- New tier: `production_ready` for no-output injection-order projection and
  additive instrument-QC metadata sidecar; `blocked` for any role/batch/matrix/
  exclusion behavior that would change quant output, counted detection,
  normalized values, workbook values, or primary matrix values.
- Evidence: the existing shared resolver in `xic_extractor.sample_metadata` is
  consumed by extraction `injection_order_source`, alignment
  `--sample-column-injection-order`, RT-normalization anchor `--sample-info`,
  and instrument-QC method-doc sidecar projection. The latest full local gate
  after the ReviewAction sidecar slice passed with `3779 passed, 1 skipped`,
  covering these parity tests without changing product values.
- Product surface changed: docs/tier wording only in this closeout. No CLI flag,
  schema column, workbook sheet, matrix schema, selected peak, selected area, or
  counted detection behavior changed.
- Validation: focused sample-metadata parity tests were rerun for this docs
  closeout:
  `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_sample_metadata.py tests\test_injection_rolling.py tests\test_extractor_run.py tests\test_instrument_qc_sequence_manifest.py tests\test_run_instrument_qc.py tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_pipeline_orders_sample_columns_by_sample_metadata_v1 tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_pipeline_orders_sample_columns_by_injection_order tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_pipeline_keeps_input_sample_order_without_injection_source tests\test_rt_normalization_anchors.py::test_injection_reference_accepts_sample_metadata_without_value_effect -q`
  (`63 passed`). No RAW/85RAW rerun is needed because this lane only projects
  metadata into existing order lookup behavior.
- Remaining blocker: role-aware QC/blank/batch/matrix/exclusion behavior still
  needs a separate expected-diff gate and product decision before any value can
  change.
- Next checkpoint: keep role metadata as pass-through context only unless a new
  product contract names the exact output values allowed to change.

### 2026-06-17 - standard_peak_generated_policy_quality_explanation_sidecar_v1

- Lane: Backfill product-authority sidecars /
  `backfill_standard_seed_guard_scope_v1`.
- Previous tier: generated policy replay was `production_ready` for the 511
  current approved-evidence / observed-oracle rows, but the 4102 blocked rows
  were still hard to explain beyond coarse `next_evidence` buckets.
- New tier at the time: unchanged for writer authority. Generated policy replay
  remained `production_ready` only for 511 `write_ready` rows; broad 4613-row
  Backfill was still described as `production_candidate`. This broad-scope tier
  statement is superseded by the 2026-06-18 `park_broad_backfill` decision; the
  sidecar itself remains explanation-only.
- Evidence: `standard_peak_backfill_productization.py` now writes
  `standard_peak_backfill_policy_quality_explanations.tsv` beside
  `standard_peak_backfill_policy.tsv` and records its path/SHA/row count in
  `standard_peak_backfill_policy_summary.json`. The sidecar has one row per
  generated policy row,
  `schema_version=standard_peak_backfill_policy_quality_explanation_v1`,
  `explanation_only=TRUE`, quality blocker count/tokens, and source clean-status
  summary. It does not modify policy row hashes, evidence classes, writer
  authority, expected-diff scope, workbook output, selected peak/area, counted
  detection, or primary matrix semantics.
- Real-data replay: no new RAW run. Existing 85RAW artifacts were replayed
  no-RAW under
  `output/productization_realdata_seed_guard_85raw_20260617/generated_policy_quality_explained_no_raw_productization/`.
  The replay classified 4613 rows as 511 `write_ready`, 0 `detected_flagged`,
  and 4102 `blocked`; writer expected-diff remained 511/511 pass. The
  summary records `backfill_policy_quality_explanation_row_count=4613`, and the
  explanation sidecar has 4613 rows. The top explanation bucket is 1087
  `missing_overlay_path` rows, followed by combined shape/height/width/scan or
  apex-delta blocker combinations.
- Validation: `$env:UV_CACHE_DIR='.uv-cache'; uv run pytest tests\test_standard_peak_backfill_productization.py -q`
  passed `31`; focused ruff and mypy passed for the productization module/test;
  the no-RAW real-data replay command exited `0`.
- Remaining blocker: this sidecar explains blocked rows; it does not make them
  writable. The old broadening checkpoint is superseded; do not use blocker
  distribution to choose another writer slice.
- Next checkpoint: superseded by
  `backfill_broad_autowrite_feasibility_gate_v1` and
  `productization_authority_mechanical_adjudication_v1`. Future work should
  build review/truth/evidence assets, not a new broad Backfill writer.

### 2026-06-17 - handoff_state_refresh_after_shape_margin_commit_v1

Historical checkpoint before `standard_peak_low_height_scoped_writer_v1`; keep
the later low-height writer entry above as the current tier source.

- Lane: documentation/control-plane closeout for the non-GUI productization
  goal.
- Previous tier: unchanged. Backfill high-signal and low-scan scoped writers
  remained `production_ready`; broad 4613-row standard-path activation and the
  low-height/apex-delta/width-only/shape-margin probes remained
  `production_candidate`; Targeted MS1 headless no-flag limited default
  remained `production_ready`; ReviewAction mutation remained parked.
- New tier: unchanged; this is a handoff drift correction, not a behavior
  promotion.
- Evidence: `cc-framework-improvements-productization.md` still had current
  state wording implying the shape-margin probe was uncommitted, the worktree
  still contained productization diff/untracked files, and no-flag `NL_FAIL`
  default rescue was still unavailable. The handoff now points at committed
  HEAD `3581a9e`, records that productization code/output scope was clean and
  the branch was ahead 12 before this docs-only refresh, and separates the ready
  Targeted MS1 headless default from the still-blocked GUI/broader-target
  surfaces. During this refresh, the only intended dirty scope is the
  handoff/control-plane docs diff.
- Validation: targeted stale-wording grep over the handoff after edit; docs-only
  diff, so no RAW rerun and no matrix/product output validation needed.
- Remaining blocker: none for this handoff drift. Product blockers remain the
  same except broad Backfill is now parked by the later 2026-06-18 feasibility
  gate; ReviewAction mutation needs stable IDs/sidecar/expected-diff approval,
  and GUI/broader Targeted MS1 rescue remain out of this ready claim.
- Next checkpoint: historical. Use the later authority/adjudication handoff as
  the current baseline; do not treat this entry as a prompt for a Backfill
  broadening slice.

### 2026-06-17 - provisional_production_candidate_gate_guard_audit_v1

- Previous tier: `diagnostic_only` with wording/no-promotion guard listed as next checkpoint.
- New tier: still `diagnostic_only`, now recorded as guarded; no product tier promotion.
- Evidence: existing CLI contract in `tools/diagnostics/provisional_backfill_candidate_gate.py` writes `alignment_production_candidate_gate.tsv/json` only; `tests/test_provisional_backfill_candidate_gate_cli.py` verifies the source matrix hash is unchanged and summary fields stay `readiness_label=diagnostic_only`, `production_ready=false`, and `matrix_contract_changed=false`.
- Product surface changed: docs/control-plane wording only. No CLI/schema/output behavior changed in this round.
- Validation: covered by full local gate `pytest -v --tb=short -x` (`3705 passed, 1 skipped`) plus `ruff`, `mypy`, diagnostics index, and `git diff --check`.
- Remaining blocker: none for diagnostic-only guard status. Any future rename is UX cleanup, not a product promotion.
- Next checkpoint: do not consume `alignment_production_candidate_gate.tsv` as product authority without a separate activation contract and expected-diff gate.

### 2026-06-16 - method_manifest_artifact_replay_policy_v1

- Previous tier: `production_ready` for targeted CLI replay parity, with ambiguous full-artifact wording
- New tier: `production_ready` for targeted CLI replay parity with explicit artifact policy; not full byte-exact workbook replay
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.output.method_manifest`; `tests/test_method_manifest.py`; `tests/test_workbook_compare.py`
- Product surface changed: additive `artifact_replay_policy` block in `method_manifest.json`.
- Safe behavior boundary: CSV artifacts are byte-exact replay artifacts; timestamped workbook parity is normalized through `scripts.compare_workbooks`; `method_manifest.json` is provenance-only because each run emits a new manifest.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_method_manifest.py tests\test_workbook_compare.py -q`
- Remaining blocker: full byte-exact workbook hash replay remains intentionally out of scope unless a future release needs stable workbook file identity.

### 2026-06-15 - alignment_output_contract_v1

- Previous tier: `production_candidate` / wording drift in control plane
- New tier: `production_surface` for output-level contract
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-11-untargeted-alignment-output-contract.md`; `xic_extractor.alignment.output_levels`; `scripts/run_alignment.py --output-level`; focused output-level tests
- Product surface changed: docs wording only; production level is `alignment_results.xlsx`, `alignment_matrix_identity.tsv`, and `review_report.html`; `alignment_matrix.tsv` remains machine/validation
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests\test_alignment_output_levels.py tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_run_alignment_production_level_writes_user_artifacts_and_identity_tsv tests\test_alignment_pipeline_outputs.py::test_run_alignment_default_stays_machine_until_owner_validation_acceptance tests\test_run_alignment.py::test_run_alignment_cli_accepts_output_level_debug tests\test_run_alignment.py::test_run_alignment_cli_accepts_validation_minimal_output_level -q`
- Remaining blocker: release gate should continue guarding production/machine/debug/validation artifact separation; this does not claim full untargeted scientific production readiness

### 2026-06-19 - discovery_row_identity_and_claim_resolved_matrix_decision_v1

- Previous tier: `product_ready_default_matrix_activated` for the tracked
  default matrix bundle; new Discovery/alignment rerun evidence was
  `diagnostic_only`.
- New tier: unchanged. No active lane or Backfill writer authority change.
- Product surface changed: future alignment matrix decision behavior changes
  for a narrow resolved-claim case. A rescued cell that was moved into its
  duplicate-claim winner family by primary consolidation can write as
  `accepted_rescue`; a true wrong-hypothesis duplicate loser remains
  `review_rescue`.
- Evidence: `xic_extractor.alignment.csv_io` accepts discovery writer display
  rounding in candidate row identity checks; `xic_extractor.alignment.promotion_policy`
  treats duplicate claims as blocking only when the current row is not the claim
  winner. The QC3 `d4-N6-2HE-dA` cell at apex RT `23.261` now writes in the
  8RAW validation-minimal matrix row `Mz=300.16`, `RT=23.4313`.
- Validation: parser regression was RED before fix; focused parser/discovery
  tests passed (`44 passed`); production decision tests passed (`23 passed`);
  8RAW alignment preflight and rerun completed under
  `output/alignment/step3_precursor_inference_8raw_20260619_parserfix_claimfix/`.
- Remaining blocker: this does not regenerate the tracked default activation
  bundle. A separate default activation expected-diff task is still required
  before claiming the tracked default `quant_matrix.tsv` contains this row.

### 2026-06-20 - CID-NL product-ready alignment evidence v1

- Lane: CID-NL Discovery-to-alignment row identity / default-output unblocker.
- Previous tier: `product_ready_default_matrix_activated` for the tracked
  511-cell Backfill default matrix bundle; CID-NL rerun evidence was not yet a
  default activation source.
- New tier: unchanged. No maturity tier, active lane, ProductWriter authority,
  Backfill writer authority, workbook/GUI behavior, selected peak/area,
  counted detection, default activation bundle, or broad Backfill state
  changed. Current default matrix authority remains exactly the existing
  511-cell `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` activation.
- Product surface changed: alignment primary-family consolidation is stricter.
  The shared-MS1 duplicate-claim fallback now only merges different
  neutral-loss tags; same-tag rows with distinct product identity must pass the
  normal product/loss identity tolerance or stay separate. The Discovery MS1
  candidate merge also reuses `ms1_feature_row_id` to merge same-feature seed
  evidence without requiring tail seed ranges to touch the peak center. These
  changes affect future Discovery/alignment row identity, not the tracked
  default ProductWriter bundle.
- Evidence: `docs/superpowers/validation/cid_nl_product_ready_alignment_v1/`
  records the 8RAW and 85RAW reruns. 8RAW alignment over
  `output/discovery/cid_nl_product_ready_8raw_20260620_fix2` produced
  `300.1605 -> 184.113` as `FAM001386`, 8/8,
  `product_matrix_identity_complete`, `identity_confidence=high`; it also
  preserved `301.165 -> 185.116` as its own `FAM001414`, 8/8,
  `product_matrix_identity_complete`, `identity_confidence=high`, with
  `consolidation_state=not_consolidated`.
- 85RAW alignment over
  `output/discovery/cid_nl_product_ready_85raw_20260620_fix2` produced
  `300.1605 -> 184.113` as `FAM011499`, 85/85,
  `product_matrix_identity_complete`, `identity_confidence=high`. The valid
  `301.165 -> 185.116` dR-tag row is preserved as `FAM011783`, 83/85,
  `product_matrix_identity_complete`, centered at
  `family_center_mz=301.165` and `family_product_mz=185.116`; it is no longer
  collapsed into the earlier erroneous `301.171 / 185.123` winner identity.
  This preserved 301 row still has `identity_confidence=review` and review
  flags for backfill evidence / missing independent backfill identity evidence;
  that residual risk is why this entry is evidence for a later expected-diff
  gate, not default activation readiness.
  TumorBC2312 provenance for the preserved row points to
  `TumorBC2312_DNA#19561@mz301.164978_p185.115845` with
  `write_matrix_value=TRUE`, while the Discovery source row remains
  `discovery_candidate_state=ms1_feature_nl_rescued` with
  `ms1_feature_row_id=TumorBC2312_DNA|DNA_dR|301.164978|23.341692`.
- Validation: red/green focused consolidation regression passed after the fix;
  `python -m pytest tests/test_alignment_primary_consolidation.py -q` passed
  `9`, and `python -m pytest tests/test_discovery_ms1_backfill.py -q` passed
  `20`. 8RAW and 85RAW alignment preflights and reruns completed with documented
  `validation-minimal`, `production-equivalent`, `audit-evidence-mode none`;
  85RAW used the canonical `validation-fast`, `raw-workers 11`, and
  `super-window` settings.
- Remaining blocker: this is `production_candidate` evidence for CID-NL
  Discovery-to-alignment row identity, not a default matrix promotion. A
  separate expected-diff/default-activation goal must decide whether these
  artifacts change the released default `quant_matrix.tsv`. That future goal
  must not treat Discovery candidates as matrix rows and must not let CID-NL/MS2
  evidence directly become ProductWriter authority.

### 2026-06-20 - CID-NL default activation preflight v1

- Lane: CID-NL Discovery-to-alignment row identity / default-output unblocker.
- Previous tier: unchanged from the tracked default
  `product_ready_default_matrix_activated` bundle plus CID-NL
  `production_candidate` alignment evidence.
- New tier: unchanged. No maturity tier, active lane, ProductWriter authority,
  Backfill writer authority, workbook/GUI behavior, selected peak/area,
  counted detection, default activation bundle, or broad Backfill state changed.
  Current default matrix authority remains exactly the existing 511-cell
  `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` activation.
- Product surface changed: additive no-write checker/report only:
  `scripts/check_cid_nl_default_activation_preflight.py`. It reads existing
  alignment/default-activation artifacts and reports whether the current
  authority bundle can replay on the new CID-NL alignment identity. It does not
  write ProductWriter/default matrix outputs and does not add a new manifest.
- Evidence:
  `docs/superpowers/validation/cid_nl_default_activation_preflight_v1/`
  records `overall_status=blocked`, `target_alignment_evidence_status=pass`,
  `replay.status=blocked`, 511 accepted authority cells, 511 expected-diff rows,
  and 506 accepted cells whose old `peak_hypothesis_id` is missing from the new
  85RAW matrix identity. The first replay blocker is
  `FAM000380/BenignfatBC0980_DNA: peak_hypothesis_id missing from matrix identity`.
  The same checker confirms `300.1605 -> 184.113` as `FAM011499`, 85/85,
  high-confidence `DNA_dR` evidence with unique TumorBC2312 provenance,
  matching family/public/group identity, and exact TumorBC2312 source
  `TumorBC2312_DNA#19561@mz300.160635_p184.113235`, and preserves
  `301.165 -> 185.116` as `FAM011783`, 83/85, review-confidence `DNA_dR`
  evidence with unique TumorBC2312 provenance, matching family/public/group
  identity, and exact TumorBC2312 source
  `TumorBC2312_DNA#19561@mz301.164978_p185.115845`.
- Heartbeat audit: the 8RAW and 85RAW alignment reruns have
  `timing.live.json`; the Discovery input artifacts have `timing.json` only.
  No new RAW or default activation run was launched for this preflight.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests/test_cid_nl_default_activation_preflight.py -q`
  passed `7`, including focused negative tests for wrong source ID,
  family/public identity mismatch, and duplicate target provenance rows;
  `uv run ruff check scripts/check_cid_nl_default_activation_preflight.py tests/test_cid_nl_default_activation_preflight.py`
  passed; the real preflight command exited `0` and wrote the blocked summary.
- Remaining blocker: default activation needs an explicit ID bridge /
  expected-diff contract that proves the current 511-cell Backfill authority is
  preserved exactly while the recovered `300.1605 -> 184.113` row is
  materialized. Do not promote by treating Discovery candidates as matrix rows
  or by letting CID-NL/MS2 evidence directly become ProductWriter authority.

### 2026-06-20 - CID-NL default activation bridge gate v1

- Lane: CID-NL Discovery-to-alignment row identity / default-output unblocker.
- Previous tier: unchanged from the tracked default
  `product_ready_default_matrix_activated` bundle plus CID-NL
  `production_candidate` alignment evidence and blocked preflight.
- New tier: unchanged. No maturity tier, active lane, ProductWriter authority,
  Backfill writer authority, workbook/GUI behavior, selected peak/area,
  counted detection, default activation bundle, or broad Backfill state changed.
  Current default matrix authority remains exactly the existing 511-cell
  `backfill_policy_write_ready_rows` activation.
- Product surface changed: additive no-write checker/report only:
  `scripts/check_cid_nl_default_activation_bridge_gate.py`. It reads the old
  default activation identity, the new CID-NL alignment identity/matrix, the
  current ProductionAcceptanceManifest, expected-diff rows, and the target
  preflight summary. It emits a diagnostic bridge summary/audit; it does not
  write default ProductWriter outputs and does not create a replacement
  authority manifest.
- Evidence:
  `docs/superpowers/validation/cid_nl_default_activation_bridge_gate_v1/`
  records `overall_status=blocked`, `target_preflight.status=pass`, 511
  accepted authority cells, 511 expected-diff rows, 0 expected-diff content
  problems, and 83 accepted peak IDs. Peak-level bridge counts are 72 `pass`
  and 11 `blocked`; cell-level bridge counts are 147 `pass` and 364 `blocked`.
  The blocked cells split into 263 `new_baseline_already_has_value`, 82
  `new_identity_ambiguous`, and 19 `new_identity_missing`. Because bridge
  blockers are present, `activation_replay.status=not_run`.
- Validation: `python -m pytest tests/test_cid_nl_default_activation_bridge_gate.py -q`
  passed `7`, including review-driven negative tests for expected-diff content
  mismatch and stale identity-to-matrix coordinates; `uv run ruff check scripts/check_cid_nl_default_activation_bridge_gate.py tests/test_cid_nl_default_activation_bridge_gate.py`
  passed; the real bridge gate command exited `0` and wrote the blocked
  summary/audit.
- Remaining blocker: a simple m/z/RT identity bridge cannot safely promote the
  CID-NL alignment artifact to default activation. The next product gate must
  reconstruct canonical row identity / authority classification first,
  separating still-blank accepted Backfill cells from cells that are now
  detected in the new baseline, before any expected-diff packet can be used for
  default activation.
