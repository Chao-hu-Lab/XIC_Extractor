# Targeted Output Reference

Column-level reference for every sheet in the Targeted Extraction Excel workbook.
The workbook is written to `<output_dir>/<batch_name>_xic_results.xlsx`.

## Overview Sheet

Summary dashboard — no tabular columns. Displays:

- Sample count, target count, review item count, diagnostics count
- Top 5 targets and top 5 samples by review items

## Score Breakdown (optional)

Enabled by setting `emit_score_breakdown=true`. One row per detection with
fine-grained scoring components.

Key columns include: `symmetry`, `local_sn`, `nl_support`, `rt_prior`,
`rt_centrality`, `noise_shape`, `peak_width`, `Quality Penalty`,
`Total Severity`, `Base Score`, `Positive Points`, `Negative Points`,
`Raw Score`, `Final Confidence`, `Quality Flags`, `Caps`, `Support`,
`Concerns`.

The exact column set depends on the active scoring model and may change
between versions.
