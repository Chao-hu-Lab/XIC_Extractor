# Decision Policy

Decision policy is the layer that turns typed evidence into workflow-owned
product decisions. It is not a new scoring formula and not a shortcut from
diagnostics into product outputs.

This page exists because "evidence chain" and "score" answer different
questions:

- Evidence explains what was observed and how trustworthy each observation is.
- Score ranks comparable candidates after the hard decision gates are satisfied.
- Workflow policy decides which evidence is required, which conflicts block the
  decision, and which projection may write or count product output.

## Contract

- Evidence providers feed typed facts into `EvidenceVector`,
  `EvidenceDecisionSemantics`, `PeakHypothesis`, `IntegrationResult`, and audit
  records. They do not write product matrices directly.
- Decision policy owns gate order. If a rule affects selected peak, selected
  area, counted detection, product state, matrix value, or output identity, the
  rule must be explicit and test-covered.
- Score is a ranking and compatibility tool. A high score cannot bypass missing
  required evidence, hard conflicts, unresolved ambiguity, missing provenance,
  or workflow-specific activation gates.
- Targeted and untargeted workflows may use the same typed evidence facts, but
  they must not share hidden product decisions. Each workflow owns its own
  projection policy.
- Diagnostic, shadow, gallery, review, lockbox, and sidecar evidence can
  explain a decision. They become product authority only through an explicit
  activation/export contract and expected-diff gate.

## Current Transition State

The codebase is not fully `PeakHypothesis`-native yet. Legacy selectors,
confidence fields, `raw_score`, `evidence_score`, `feature_family_id`,
`public_family_id`, and string evidence fields still exist because they are
public compatibility surfaces or migration adapters.

Treat those surfaces as compatibility or audit signals unless another owner
promotes them through typed evidence semantics, workflow projection, parity
evidence, or approved expected-diff records. A compatibility oracle is a
baseline for proving behavior, not the owner of product truth.

## Layers

| Layer | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Typed evidence facts | Observed RT, shape, boundary, MS2, NL, isotope/adduct, standards, library, paired-context, and provenance facts | Product state, counted detection, matrix value |
| Decision semantics | Accepted/review/not-counted/ambiguous/excluded classes, support reasons, conflict reasons, blocker reasons | Workflow-specific writer authority |
| Model selection / ranking | Choosing among comparable `PeakHypothesis` candidates after typed gates | Overriding hard gates or granting matrix writes |
| Workflow projection | Targeted product projection, alignment projection, Backfill authority, ProductWriter gates | Low-level evidence extraction |
| Audit trail | Human-readable explanation, review queue, expected-diff evidence | Silent product behavior |

## Common Decision Shape

Every value-changing decision should be explainable in this order:

1. **Unit:** what is being decided: target candidate, `PeakHypothesis`, sample
   cell, cross-sample group, or matrix value.
2. **Required evidence:** typed facts that must be present before the decision
   can be considered.
3. **Blockers:** conflicts, ambiguity, provenance gaps, sample-role exclusions,
   wrong-peak evidence, or missing activation authority.
4. **Support:** facts that strengthen the selected unit but do not independently
   grant authority.
5. **Tie-break:** deterministic ranking among still-comparable candidates.
6. **Projection:** the workflow-owned output decision and the artifact or test
   that authorizes it.

If a decision cannot name these fields, it is not ready to become product
behavior. It can remain diagnostic, shadow, or review-only.

## Targeted Policy

Targeted selection is hypothesis-driven. The workflow already knows target
identity, role, target window, expected MS2/NL behavior, and paired standards
when they are configured. That knowledge is part of the assay contract, not a
generic evidence provider.

| Decision role | Targeted rule |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Candidate `PeakHypothesis` for a known target/sample pair |
| Required evidence | Selected candidate or explicit no-peak state, target identity, target/sample applicability, positive MS1 state when counted, and provenance-valid trace context |
| Hard blockers | Sample not applicable, invalid selected hypothesis, hard wrong-peak conflict, missing positive MS1 for counted detection, unapproved expected diff, role-incoherent paired context, missing activation for value-changing rescue |
| Support | Candidate-aligned MS2/NL, target RT window, paired ISTD/standard RT context, paired area ratio, own-max same-peak support, morphology, boundary assessability, local S/N |
| Tie-break | Decision class first, then blocker count, abundance demotion, role-aware RT/context, chemical evidence, trace strength, quality penalty, RT distance, abundance, and finally compatibility score only when comparable |
| Projection | `TargetedProductProjection` owns product state, counted detection, confidence, reason, and targeted output fields |

Targeted policy may prioritize paired ISTD/standard RT context because the
targeted method declares that relationship ahead of time. That priority must
remain in targeted projection or activation policy; it must not leak into
untargeted identity decisions as if the workflow had known targets.

Targeted-specific rules to keep explicit:

- Positive MS1 means a finite selected RT and positive area. Without that, the
  row or cell must project to explicit no-peak or not-counted state, not counted
  detection by implication.
- Sample applicability gates can exclude a target/sample pair before scoring,
  such as role or matrix constraints.
- ISTD and analyte missing-MS2/NL behavior are not symmetric. A configured ISTD
  plausible dropout can be counted as `detected_flagged`; an analyte NL fail or
  missing MS2 needs paired-support or expected-diff policy before it can count.
- Paired analyte support is a bundle: coherent MS1, role-aware RT context,
  paired-area support, same-peak support, and no hard quality blocker. No single
  paired fact is standalone product authority.
- Expected-diff support is product-relevant only when the selected row,
  affected outputs, validation tier, and matrix impact are explicitly approved.
- `legacy_review_only_projection` and legacy confidence labels are review or
  compatibility context; they do not by themselves create a not-counted product
  decision.

## Untargeted / Backfill Policy

Untargeted alignment and Backfill are discovery-driven. They do not know the
target identity ahead of time, so they must decide from trace, owner, group,
identity, and provenance evidence rather than targeted labels.

| Decision role | Untargeted / Backfill rule |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Separate decisions for owner edge, cross-sample group, matrix row identity, rescued cell, quant value, and activation output |
| Required evidence | Explicit discovery/alignment input, owner construction, row identity, typed same-peak evidence when claiming same-peak support, and provenance-valid sidecar when used for product support |
| Hard blockers | Ambiguous owner, duplicate loser, wrong-peak conflict, missing matrix identity, stale source hash, unsupported family projection, unapproved authority scope, missing expected-diff gate for new writer behavior |
| Support | Cross-sample coherence, m/z/RT consistency, MS1 pattern, shape and boundary agreement, MS2/NL consistency, standards/library evidence when represented as typed facts |
| Tie-break | Owner-edge evidence, group match quality, drift-corrected RT, m/z/product tolerances, seed support, owner quality, trace quality, duplicate context, deterministic row ordering, and score only within already-eligible comparable candidates |
| Projection | `MatrixIdentityRowDecision` decides row inclusion; `ProductionCellDecision`, Backfill authority, ProductWriter, and activation contracts decide matrix presence and accepted quant values |

Targeted outputs may be used as benchmark, audit, or falsification evidence for
untargeted behavior. They must not directly promote untargeted rows unless a
separate product contract converts that evidence into typed same-peak,
group-hypothesis, or `PeakHypothesis` support.

Untargeted-specific rules to keep explicit:

- Owner-edge score supports group construction only after hard gates pass. It
  cannot override same-sample conflicts, tag mismatch, m/z/product/NL mismatch,
  ambiguous owner, identity conflict, non-detected owner, or backfill-bridge
  blockers.
- Row promotion requires row identity support and at least one quantifiable
  detected seed. Rescue-only, duplicate-only, ambiguous-only, review-only,
  consolidation-loser, and zero-detected rows fail closed unless an explicit
  authority contract says otherwise.
- A rescued cell can write only after row identity passes and the cell is
  quantifiable. If backfill cell evidence is required, product-authorized
  same-peak Backfill evidence is also required.
- Same-peak support is not the same as group membership. It needs selected peak
  geometry, RT or drift-supported compatibility, no MS1 pattern conflict, no
  hypothesis or claim blocker, and product-authorized trace or pattern support.
- MS2/NL, MS1 pattern, QC reference, matrix RT drift, and shape or region audit
  are typed facts. They strengthen or block decisions only through Backfill
  projection and authority fields.
- `feature_family_id` and `public_family_id` remain compatibility/display
  labels. `group_hypothesis_id` and `peak_hypothesis_id` are the
  authority-ready identity handles when available.
- Owner-centered MS1 backfill can change alignment cell status during alignment
  construction. That is still not broad ProductWriter authority unless the
  relevant matrix/activation contract grants it.
- Broad Backfill remains gated. Diagnostic sidecars, `shadow_gate_ready`, and
  visual overlay evidence are not production readiness by themselves.

## Score Position

Score is allowed when it makes a bounded ranking decision easier to inspect:

- rank candidates that already passed the same hard gates;
- provide compatibility parity while legacy public outputs still expose score,
  confidence, reason, or score breakdown;
- calibrate thresholds for future policy, with expected-diff review before any
  public output changes;
- summarize quality within a typed fact, such as shape similarity or MS2
  similarity, when the threshold and provenance are explicit.
- act as one seed-quality feature in alignment, provided seed events, scan
  support, identity constraints, and other gates still pass.

Score is not allowed to:

- make a candidate product truth by itself;
- override wrong-peak, ambiguity, missing-provenance, sample-role, or authority
  blockers;
- replace a lower-score candidate when typed facts produce worse decision
  semantics for the higher-score candidate;
- collapse targeted and untargeted policy into one global weighting scheme;
- turn diagnostic-only or shadow-only artifacts into matrix values;
- hide a new product rule behind a numeric threshold without an owner, tests,
  and expected-diff framing.

When a threshold is unavoidable, name it as a gate with a reason and validation
tier instead of treating it as a universal weight.

Names that contain `score` need extra care:

- `raw_score`, `EvidenceScore.confidence`, support labels, concern labels, and
  cap labels are compatibility or audit projections unless wrapped by typed
  evidence semantics and an approved product policy.
- `select_candidate_with_confidence` is a legacy compatibility selector while
  public behavior still exposes legacy confidence and reason fields.
- Alignment `evidence_score` is a seed-quality score feature, not same-peak
  identity proof and not ProductWriter authority.
- `legacy_peak_scoring_current_oracle` is a parity baseline, not a product
  owner.

## Decision Record Requirements

New or promoted decision paths should emit or preserve enough information to
reconstruct the policy:

| Field class | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Unit identity | `target_label`, sample, `peak_hypothesis_id`, `group_hypothesis_id`, matrix row/cell identity |
| Required evidence status | present/missing/inconclusive typed facts and source artifact hashes |
| Blockers | conflict, ambiguity, stale source, unsupported projection, missing activation |
| Support | RT, shape, MS2/NL, standard/library, paired-context, group/coherence support |
| Tie-break basis | score, RT distance, abundance, deterministic order, compatibility fallback |
| Projection authority | targeted projection, alignment projection, Backfill authority, ProductWriter scope |
| Validation status | synthetic, focused tests, targeted benchmark, 8RAW, 85RAW, manual review, expected diff |

The decision record can live in different artifacts for different workflows,
but the meaning must remain stable: evidence explains, policy gates, score
ranks, and projection writes. Reserve `Trace` for LC-MS chromatogram signals;
do not use it as shorthand for decision records.
`DecisionRecord.gate` and `DecisionRecord.tie_break` are audit-visible policy
terms, not a generic selection key. Only workflow-owned selection modules may
convert those terms into ordering keys. Audit-visible means a promoted workflow
must preserve the terms in its owning record, sidecar, or public output when
they explain product behavior; it does not mean every current review TSV emits a
complete `DecisionRecord`.
`DecisionRecord.projection_authority` names the workflow owner allowed to
project or count the result. It is not an evidence token, score field, shadow
artifact label, or display writer name. New product authority labels need the
same public-output expected-diff framing as any other behavior-changing writer
contract.

## Red Lines

- Do not say "the score decided the peak." Say which typed facts passed, which
  blockers were absent, and which projection wrote the output.
- Do not let a shared evidence provider carry workflow-specific authority.
- Do not move targeted-only role policy into shared evidence semantics unless
  the output stays role-neutral or the projection layer still owns authority.
- Do not treat review labels, display tokens, family labels, galleries, or
  lockbox labels as product writes.
- Do not count multiple derived facts as independent evidence when they come
  from the same physical observation.
- Do not change selected peak, selected area, counted detection, matrix values,
  identity sidecars, or output schemas without expected-diff framing and focused
  output tests.
