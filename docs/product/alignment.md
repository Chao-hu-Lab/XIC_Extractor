# Alignment

Alignment is the cross-sample handoff layer. It consumes explicit discovery or
accepted input, builds owners and aligned matrices, and writes machine-readable
contracts for review and downstream product decisions.

## Contract

- Alignment inputs must be explicit: accepted target input, discovery batch
  index, or documented local validation input. Do not rely on old worktree
  output paths as durable inputs.
- `validation-minimal` is the standard fast public validation profile unless a
  stronger gate is explicitly requested.
- Alignment may write matrix, review, identity, evidence, and conditional
  provenance sidecars. Sidecars support review but do not become product
  authority without the authority manifest and expected-diff contract.
- Legacy `feature_family_id` / `public_family_id` preserve public row labels
  and compatibility traceability. `group_hypothesis_id` carries successor
  cross-sample identity when available; product projection decides whether that
  identity may write or count.
- Successor/group identity, gap-fill semantics, and workbook metadata
  versioning are public behavior when they affect alignment outputs and must
  stay repo-readable.
- `alignment_review.tsv` tokens are review context only. Positive support must
  come from provenance-valid sidecars or explicit authority records, not from
  display tokens alone.
- Row-level diagnostic risk tokens such as `row_flags=high_backfill_dependency`
  are guardrail pressure. Diagnostics may count them before legacy `warning`
  compatibility fields, but they do not promote rows into production authority.
- Output filenames, row ordering, column schema, schema-version signals, and
  identity/provenance sidecars are public contracts.
- Runner scripts orchestrate inputs, profiles, and output locations. Reusable
  grouping, ownership, identity, writer, and sidecar behavior belongs in
  package modules or explicit specs.

## Retained Validation Anchors

- The 2026-05-28 targeted GT alignment audit fixtures for `5-medC` are
  diagnostic anchors for the 8RAW validation-minimal and primary-delivery-fix
  alignment slices. Both recorded `PASS 8/8`, zero `SPLIT`, zero `DRIFT`, zero
  `DUPLICATE`, and zero `MISS` against the targeted GT RT rows.
- Those fixture reports prove the audited alignment slice did not lose the
  `5-medC` targeted rows, but they do not grant ProductWriter authority,
  broaden matrix publication, or replace stronger 85RAW/product gates.
- Historical `FAM*` labels in those reports are compatibility traceability for
  the audited run. They are not canonical cross-sample identity proof when a
  successor group or PeakHypothesis surface exists.

## Surfaces

| Output | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `alignment_matrix.tsv` | Cross-sample aligned values |
| `alignment_review.tsv` | Human/machine review summary |
| `alignment_matrix_identity.tsv` | Identity and owner traceability |
| `alignment_backfill_cell_evidence.tsv` | Backfill-related cell evidence sidecar |
| `alignment_run_metadata.json` | Conditional run settings and provenance sidecar |
| `alignment-results-v2/v3` metadata | Schema-version signals for public behavior changes |

## Boundaries

| Area | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alignment | Cross-sample grouping, owner construction, primary consolidation, sidecar emission | Discovery seed creation, workbook rendering, product writer authority |
| Discovery | Candidate generation and per-sample review surfaces | Cross-sample matrix authority |
| Output | Rendering TSV/XLSX/HTML artifacts from domain decisions | Recomputing evidence or selecting authority |
| Diagnostics | Audits and observability | Product behavior unless promoted through public contract |

## Verification

Before changing alignment behavior, require the relevant subset of:

- Focused tests for changed TSV schemas, row ordering, identity sidecars, or
  owner construction.
- Runner/profile smoke check for documented command shapes.
- Expected-diff and authority review if matrix values become product-facing.
- Downstream consumer check when output filenames or columns change.
- RAW-tier evidence label matching the claim (synthetic, 8RAW, or 85RAW)
  without promoting a lower tier as production readiness.

## Pitfalls

- Treating alignment sidecars as ProductWriter authority.
- Treating legacy family labels as canonical identity proof after a successor
  group or PeakHypothesis surface exists.
- Using old worktree output paths as durable inputs.
- Changing output columns without updating specs, tests, and downstream docs.
- Claiming product readiness from `validation-minimal` alone.
- Treating gap-filled or successor-group sidecar rows as product authority
  without a matching output contract.
- Letting `alignment_review.tsv` support tokens promote rows without
  provenance-valid source sidecars.
