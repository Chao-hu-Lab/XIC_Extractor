# Peak Anchor, Cross-Sample Group, and Hypothesis Boundary

This page defines the durable boundary between per-sample peak anchors,
cross-sample group hypotheses, peak hypotheses, and product projections. Use it
when a change touches discovery peak-anchor grouping, alignment owner
construction, Backfill activation, or any matrix identity sidecar.

## Contract

- `peak_anchor_id` (discovery `feature_family_id`) groups candidates that share
  the same MS1 chromatographic peak within a single sample. It is a per-sample
  trace-identity label, not a chemical identity claim.
- `CrossSamplePeakGroupHypothesis` owns cross-sample group identity:
  membership, owner edge evidence, hard split gates, review-only records, and
  group delivery metadata. Use `group_hypothesis_id` for identity.
- `PeakHypothesis` owns candidate chromatographic identity: the physical peak
  candidate, selected integration, typed evidence, and selected-hypothesis
  decision semantics.
- Workflow projection owns product decisions. Targeted projection, alignment
  projection, Backfill authority, and ProductWriter gates decide counted
  detection, matrix presence, and product output values.
- Legacy score, confidence, family role, and review tokens may rank, annotate,
  or preserve compatibility behavior. They must not become standalone product
  truth.

## Roles

| Concept | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discovery `peak_anchor_id` / output `feature_family_id` | Per-sample MS1 peak identity and review grouping | Cross-sample identity, Backfill promotion, selected-peak truth |
| Alignment `public_family_id` (display label) | Stable public row label for output compatibility | Canonical identity proof - use `group_hypothesis_id` instead |
| `CrossSamplePeakGroupHypothesis` | Cross-sample owner/group identity via `group_hypothesis_id` | Per-peak integration truth or ProductWriter authority |
| `PeakHypothesis` | Candidate peak identity, evidence context, selected hypothesis semantics | Cross-sample grouping policy or final matrix writing |
| Product projection / ProductWriter | Counted detection, product state, matrix value authority | Low-level evidence extraction or review-only grouping |

## Migration Rule

The codebase is in a compatibility transition. Discovery outputs still expose
`feature_family_id` for per-sample peak anchors, and alignment outputs still
expose `public_family_id` or legacy `feature_family_id` as cross-sample group
display labels. Treat this as an adapter state:

1. Preserve legacy IDs when they are public output contracts.
2. Add successor IDs alongside legacy IDs when identity semantics become
   product-relevant.
3. Use `group_hypothesis_id` for successor alignment identity decisions when a
   workflow has promoted it as the decision key. Until then, public
   matrix/projection maps may still key by legacy row labels and must describe
   that compatibility state.
4. Do not collapse multiple source peak anchors or cross-sample groups into one
   product row unless an explicit split/consolidation contract and tests approve
   it.
5. Keep review-only group context out of ProductWriter authority unless it is
   converted into typed same-peak or group-hypothesis evidence.

## Design Red Lines

- Do not say "the score decides whether the peak is trustworthy." Say which
  evidence facts, selected hypothesis, and workflow projection own the decision.
- Do not use discovery peak-anchor membership as cross-sample identity proof.
  Cross-sample identity belongs to `CrossSamplePeakGroupHypothesis` and
  `group_hypothesis_id`.
- Do not use cross-sample group membership as same-peak proof. Same-peak support
  needs a typed anchor, selected mode, or PeakHypothesis-level reason.
- Do not let `alignment_review.tsv` display tokens promote rows. Positive
  product support needs provenance-valid sidecars or explicit authority records.
- Do not treat `family_projection` rows as canonical identity proof. They are
  unresolved projection rows until replaced by explicit PeakHypothesis
  assignments or an approved product contract says they are out of scope.
- Helpers that can emit or include `family_projection` rows must default to
  excluding them. Any inclusion path needs an explicit diagnostic or compatibility
  opt-in and must keep canonical identity readiness fail-closed.

## Codebase Smells To Audit

These patterns are not automatically bugs, but they require close review before
refactor or promotion:

- A peak-anchor assignment function writes `evidence_score`, `evidence_tier`,
  confidence, or product-like status.
- A cross-sample alignment path keys product behavior only by
  `feature_family_id` or `public_family_id` when `group_hypothesis_id` or
  `peak_hypothesis_id` is available.
- A diagnostic sidecar exposes supportive labels without product-authority
  provenance.
- A new helper extracts shared code by moving discovery/alignment policy into
  `peak_detection/` instead of keeping the helper trace-level and role-neutral.

## Verification

Before changing peak-anchor, owner, cross-sample group, group-hypothesis, or
PeakHypothesis behavior, require the relevant subset of:

- focused tests for row identity, sidecar columns, and deterministic duplicate
  policy;
- expected-diff approval if selected peak, selected area, counted detection,
  matrix values, or product row identity can change;
- artifact provenance checks for Backfill evidence used as product support;
- RAW-tier evidence label matching the claim.
