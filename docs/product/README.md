# Product Topic Index

Reference pages for XIC product behavior and ownership. Audience: maintainers
and code reviewers. For user-facing workflow guides, see
[`docs/user/`](../user/README.md).

Use this index when a GUI workflow, preset, review surface, matrix, or
validation claim needs a durable rule instead of a dated plan or private note.
For definitions of domain-specific terms used in these pages, see the
[Glossary](glossary.md).

## Authority Boundary

Topic pages summarize durable rules but do not replace their upstream owners.
If a topic file conflicts with an owner listed below, the owner wins.

- [LC-MS/MS evidence rules](../lc-msms-evidence-rules.md)
- [Architecture contract](../architecture-contract.md)
- [Productization control plane](../superpowers/plans/2026-06-15-productization-control-plane.md)
  and its [status index](../superpowers/validation/productization_status_index_v1.tsv)
  / [authority manifest](../superpowers/schemas/productization_authority_manifest.v1.json)

## Contributor Rules

- Add a topic page only when durable public rules need a small entry point.
  Do not add pages to preserve branch diaries or private review threads.
- Use a lean reference-page style: one-paragraph purpose, tables, concise
  contract rules, and links to owners. Avoid repeating shared governance in
  every file — put it here instead.
- Do not copy dated plans, private investigation detail, local paths, or
  command transcripts into this directory.
- Topic pages do not change maturity tier, active lane, writer authority,
  matrix behavior, schema, or validation verdicts.
- Product-story HTML can stay here only as an explainer. If it conflicts with
  topic pages, the control plane, status index, or authority manifest, those
  owners win.

### Shared Conventions

These apply to all topic pages and do not need to be restated in each file:

- **Evidence labels** (`diagnostic_only`, `shadow_ready`,
  `production_candidate`, `production_ready`) describe what a branch or
  validation run verified. They are not inherent properties of a topic page.
- **ProductWriter authority** is the only path that writes product matrices.
  Sidecars, review surfaces, galleries, and diagnostics can explain or gate a
  decision, but they do not write product values unless the authority manifest
  explicitly grants that role.
- **Cleanup policy**: dated plans, command transcripts, and sample-level
  investigation can move to private notes after their stable public claims
  are represented in the relevant topic page or source owner.
- **Update triggers**: update a topic page when it gains or changes a durable
  output, contract, boundary, or verification gate. If the change affects
  product authority, update the owning spec and tests first.
