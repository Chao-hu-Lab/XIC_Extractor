name: xic-goal-execution
description: XIC Extractor overlay for the global goal-execution skill. Use when the user asks to create, tighten, review, audit, execute, or close a goal for XIC work, or when an XIC task is phase-sized, RAW/data-backed, PR-ready, CI/release-like, cross-turn, or repeatedly drifting. First use the global `goal-execution` contract shape, then apply XIC-specific goal quality gates, context, validation tiers, RAW stop rules, and handoff/productization constraints. Do not use for tiny bug fixes, simple commits, one-command status checks, or focused RAW validation with an obvious done state.

# XIC Goal Execution

This is a repo-specific overlay. The reusable workflow lives in the global
`goal-execution` skill. Do not duplicate the global workflow here.

If the global skill is unavailable, report `global skill unavailable` and use
`AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-subagent-routing.md`, and the XIC additions below as
the fallback goal contract.

Use the global skill first for:

- source-backed goal shape;
- `create`, `tighten`, `review`, and `execute` modes;
- runtime goal creation rules;
- full and compact templates;
- completion audit and stop rules.

Then apply the XIC-specific additions below.

## Execution Modes

Pick the smallest mode that fits the user's request:

- `create`: turn a broad request into one measurable goal contract.
- `tighten`: fix an existing goal that is too broad, unverifiable, or missing
  stop rules.
- `review`: critique a proposed goal before execution; do not edit code.
- `execute`: work against the accepted goal and update progress only when
  evidence changes.
- `audit`: check whether an active goal is still valid after new artifacts,
  reviewer findings, CI results, or user direction.
- `close`: verify completion, name residual risk, leave handoff, and mark the
  runtime goal complete only when the objective is actually achieved.

If the user asks to "set a goal and handle it", start with `tighten` for one
pass, then `execute`. Do not skip the quality gate just because the user is
eager to proceed.

## Default-First Goal Drafting

When creating a goal, output the best copy-ready goal first. Do not lead with a
blank template or a long questionnaire.

- If uncertainty is low-risk, choose conservative defaults and state the
  assumption.
- Ask only when the answer changes cost, risk, ownership, public contracts, or
  product direction.
- If the domain or artifact is unfamiliar, make the goal discovery-first:
  inspect repo docs, existing scripts, sample data, official references, or
  user-provided material before implementation.
- If choices are needed, use short numbered options with a recommended default.
  Avoid open-ended interviews unless a multiple-choice version would hide an
  important decision.
- Keep `/goal` as the executable command prefix. For Chinese users, the goal
  body can be Chinese; do not change the command to `/目標` or `/目标`.

## Minimal Goal Shape

If the global skill cannot be loaded, create or tighten goals with this compact
shape:

```markdown
Objective:
Context:
Constraints:
In scope:
Out of scope:
Current surfaces/artifacts:
Plan:
Verification:
Boundaries:
Iteration policy:
Done when:
Pause if:
Stop rules:
Handoff:
```

Keep `Objective` singular. If the work has multiple independent outcomes,
split the goal or name the primary objective and make the rest explicit
non-goals. `Done when` must be auditable from files, commands, PR state, or
validation artifacts.

## Goal Quality Gate

Before creating or executing an XIC goal, inspect the contract. Tighten or stop
when any answer is weak:

- **Single objective**: Is there exactly one primary outcome? If not, split the
  goal or state the non-goals.
- **Phase type**: Is it docs, cleanup, diagnostic, engineering, science,
  behavior change, PR/CI, or release? Mixed phase types need explicit ordering.
- **Decision closure**: What decision can this goal close? If the proposed gate
  cannot change the next action, shrink or remove it.
- **Tool leverage**: Which available tools, subagents, plugins, diagnostics, or
  existing artifacts can close the decision fastest and with the strongest
  evidence? Do not choose a weaker route only to save tokens or cost.
- **Verification fit**: Does verification match the phase type: focused tests,
  artifact parity, 8RAW, 85RAW, targeted benchmark, manual EIC/MS2 review, or
  CI? Do not overclaim a weaker tier.
- **Boundaries**: Does the goal name allowed write surfaces and forbidden paths
  separately from behavioral constraints?
- **Iteration policy**: Does it require one focused change at a time, rerunning
  relevant checks after meaningful edits, and a new source of evidence after
  repeated failures?
- **Public contract risk**: Does it touch CLI/config, TSV/CSV/workbook schema,
  matrix identity, activation decisions, selected peak/area, or downstream
  handoff fields? If yes, require a contract update and focused output test.
- **Architecture risk**: Does it add diagnostics, RAW-backed evidence, preset
  performance work, matrix activation, HCD-PI, Delta Mass, CID-NL expansion, or
  a new evidence provider? If yes, use `xic-architecture-preflight` first.
- **Stop rules**: Are there concrete conditions that require user decision,
  a different evidence source, or stopping the current loop instead of blind
  continuation?
- **Pause conditions**: Are external permissions, credentials, production data,
  destructive operations, unclear ownership, or product-direction decisions
  separated from normal completion?
- **Handoff**: Will a later agent know what changed, what was verified, what
  remains risky, and where the artifacts are?

Do not create or continue a runtime goal if the objective is only "improve
everything", "clean up the repo", or "finish all architecture debt" without a
bounded surface and verification gate.

## Governor Behavior

While executing:

- Keep the active goal visible in decisions; do not drift into adjacent cleanup.
- Use tools aggressively but with a decision map. Prefer existing diagnostics,
  specs, and validation outputs before rerunning expensive RAW jobs when those
  artifacts answer the same question; otherwise use the stronger tool or run.
- After the same failure shape repeats twice, stop retrying the same approach:
  inspect logs/artifacts, reduce to a smaller repro, consult docs, or report the
  blocker.
- If the work uncovers a larger backlog, record it as follow-up instead of
  silently expanding the goal.
- If a reviewer finding, CI failure, or new data invalidates the goal contract,
  switch to `audit` and report the mismatch before continuing.
- Near closeout, compare the actual diff and verification against `Done when`.
  Do not mark complete because the budget is low or because partial work is
  useful.

## XIC Handoff Snapshot Discipline

Apply the global current-state handoff rule through this skill because XIC
goals are usually launched via `$goal-execution`.

Use the active handoff named by the goal, plan, or PR workflow. If none is
named and a repo-tracked handoff is needed, create or update a branch-scoped
file under `docs/superpowers/handoffs/current/<branch-slug>-<topic>.md`; use
`HANDOFF.md` only when the current goal establishes it as the active file.
Never update a handoff whose `Branch:` / `Status:` belongs to another branch.
The active handoff is a short continuation snapshot, not the productization
tier authority. Tier history, per-round maintenance logs, and lane evidence
belong in the control plane, named specs, validation notes, or archive.
Long exploration logs and scratch analysis belong in notes, not the active
handoff.

For XIC, the same three-layer rule applies even when filenames differ:

- active handoff: short current-state snapshot;
- archive: completed phase summaries only, not raw progress logs;
- notes: optional long logs, scratch analysis, and temporary exploration.

Before each meaningful checkpoint, compact-risk pause, or closeout:

1. Inspect `git status`, the intended dirty scope, and latest validation
   evidence.
2. Rewrite the active handoff from current repo state instead of appending a
   chronological update.
3. Prune completed, superseded, stale, or intermediate details. Keep only active
   constraints, decisions, blockers, validation, relevant file changes, rejected
   paths still likely to be repeated, and next 1-3 concrete actions.
4. Use `[active]`, `[blocked]`, `[done]`, and `[superseded]` labels where they
   make pruning easier. Remove `[done]` and `[superseded]` items during the next
   update unless they remain important rejected-path warnings.
5. Near PR closeout, condense the current handoff into the PR body; archive only
   compact completed phase summaries that need to remain in repo.
6. If the active handoff is over about 200 lines, prune it before continuing
   unless the user explicitly asks for a longer handoff.

Hooks may remind that the handoff is stale or missing from a productization
update. They must not be treated as the author of the handoff; the executing
agent owns the rewrite and pruning.

## Required XIC Context

Every non-trivial XIC goal should read:

- `AGENTS.md`;
- `docs/agent-subagent-routing.md`;
- `docs/agent-parameter-settings.md` if Python, RAW, validation, DLLs, timing,
  output levels, or long-running commands are involved;
- the active spec, plan, note, PR, diagnostic index, or validation output named
  by the user;
- existing artifacts under `output/` or `docs/superpowers/` before rerunning
  expensive validation.

## XIC Constraints To Consider

Add these when relevant:

- preserve public contracts: CLI flags, config keys, TSV/workbook schemas,
  `alignment_matrix.tsv`, downstream handoff fields, and diagnostic marker maps;
- distinguish `diagnostic_only`, `shadow_ready`, `production_candidate`,
  `production_ready`, and `inconclusive`;
- do not treat wrapper/report/sidecar existence as product behavior;
- do not run 85RAW through background `Start-Process` from the Codex shell;
- do not generate large `.xlsx`, HTML, owner-edge, status-matrix, event-owner,
  or ambiguous-owner artifacts for validation unless the task explicitly needs
  them;
- do not let cleanup phases change production behavior unless the goal says so;
- do not polish legacy DTOs when the goal is handoff productization unless that
  directly advances the spine contract.

## XIC Verification Tiers

Name the tier in `VERIFY` and final output:

- synthetic no-RAW tests;
- focused unit/contract tests;
- 8RAW validation;
- 85RAW validation;
- targeted benchmark;
- manual EIC/MS2 review;
- CI shard / GitHub checks.

If real-data validation is skipped, say why and what future evidence would close
the risk.

## XIC Stop Rules

Stop instead of guessing when:

- a planned change touches public schemas, workbook sheets, CLI/config keys, or
  `alignment_matrix.tsv` without a contract update;
- RAW runner paths, Thermo DLLs, or output levels are unclear;
- a long RAW run lacks heartbeat/timing sidecars or starts repeating a known
  failed launch pattern;
- the goal's gate cannot change the next action;
- the same failure shape repeats twice without new evidence;
- a reviewer finding contradicts the user's product direction and needs a
  decision.
