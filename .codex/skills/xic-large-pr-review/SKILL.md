# XIC Large PR Review

Use this after adopting the normal code-review stance: findings first, ordered by
severity, with exact file and line references when findings exist.

This skill is for review only. Do not edit files, stage, push, update PRs, or
merge unless the user separately asks.

## Scope Check

Start with read-only state:

```powershell
git status --short --branch
gh pr view --json number,title,state,isDraft,baseRefName,headRefName,mergeable,commits,statusCheckRollup,url
$base = gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq ".baseRefName"
git diff --stat "origin/$base...HEAD"
git diff --name-only "origin/$base...HEAD"
```

If the worktree is dirty, say whether the dirty files affect the review. Do not
revert or stage anything.

## Review Strategy

Do not try to spend equal attention on every changed file in a huge PR. Build a
blast-radius map and review in this order:

1. Package-neutral or shared helpers used by many writers or diagnostics.
2. Public contract surfaces: CLI flags, config keys, TSV/CSV/workbook schemas,
   matrix identity, activation decisions, value deltas, and output paths.
3. Diagnostic architecture boundaries between `tools/diagnostics/` orchestration
   and reusable `xic_extractor/diagnostics/` package logic.
4. RAW access locality, batching, reuse, caching, and any fallback path that can
   silently change evidence availability.
5. Product-vs-diagnostic claims: whether wrappers, sidecars, reports, or gates
   are being overclaimed as production behavior.
6. Focused tests, parity gates, and real-data evidence that match the PR intent.

For mechanical writer migrations, verify representative callers and the shared
formatter rather than reading every identical call site. Check whether custom
formatters, line terminators, encodings, hidden schema fields, and row order are
preserved.

## XIC Evidence Labels

State the strongest evidence actually reviewed:

- `synthetic_only`
- `focused_tests`
- `ci_green`
- `8RAW_parity`
- `85RAW_parity`
- `targeted_benchmark`
- `manual_eic_ms2_review`
- `diagnostic_only`
- `inconclusive`

Do not treat `8RAW` evidence as proof of `85RAW` readiness. If 85RAW was
intentionally skipped, say so as residual risk, not as a failure.

## Parity And Public Contract Checks

When the PR mentions matrix-only, deep-audit, activation, or value delta, look
for evidence covering:

- activation decisions;
- activation value delta;
- matrix cell values and sample identity;
- matrix identity sidecars;
- row ordering or deterministic duplicate policy;
- publication mode differences such as image rendering disabled but evidence
  TSVs preserved.

When the PR touches RAW access or overlay extraction, check that batching and
cache changes preserve:

- one output row per requested family/sample/seed;
- fallback behavior when scan-window or retention-time lookup is unavailable;
- trace cropping back to the original request window;
- explicit counts for RAW opens, XIC requests, batch calls, super-window groups,
  and trace points when those metrics exist.

## Output Format

Use this review shape:

```markdown
**Findings**

- [P1/P2/P3] <issue title> — <file:line>
  <why this can break behavior, schema, validation, or reviewability>

**Open Questions / Assumptions**

<Only include if they affect the verdict.>

**Verification Reviewed**

<CI, focused local tests, parity evidence, or artifacts inspected.>

**Residual Risk**

<What remains unproven, especially because of PR size or skipped RAW tier.>
```

If no blocking issue is found, say that clearly. Do not invent findings just to
make the review look useful.

## Stop Rules

Stop and report the limitation when:

- the PR base cannot be determined;
- CI status cannot be checked and no local gate can substitute;
- the diff is too large for full manual coverage and no meaningful blast-radius
  map can be built;
- a suspected issue cannot be grounded in a changed file, public contract, or
  focused test gap.

For subagent review, use repo routing in `docs/agent/subagent-routing.md` only
when the user explicitly asks for subagents or when runtime policy permits it.
