"""Compose the backfill + MS1 overlay reconciliation gallery from alignment output.

``run_alignment`` only emits the tabular contract (matrix / review / cells). The
review gallery the user actually inspects — "explain why backfill" plus the MS1
overlay — is built by three further steps:

1. retained backfill evidence gate -> the overlay *review queue* (which families
   still need an overlay rendered) and the retained-gate TSV the gallery reads.
2. family MS1 overlay batch -> per-family overlay PNGs + a summary TSV. This is
   the only render-heavy step; it is parametrised on ``dpi`` / ``workers`` so the
   GUI can keep it inside the render budget.
3. reconciliation gallery -> the standalone HTML the GUI opens.

Keeping this composition in one testable place lets the worker call it after
alignment without embedding multi-step orchestration in a ``QThread``.

This is the lightweight "Tier A" review gallery: it deliberately does *not* run
the shift-aware experiment batch, shadow projection, or matrix activation (the
heavier "deep-audit" / production-contract layers in
``standard_peak_backfill_machine_pipeline``). Those change the matrix and carry a
second render pass; they are a separate concern from visual review.
